consider the abstract: $ transforming growth factor β integrates smad 3 to mechanistic target of rapamycin complexes to arrest deptor abundance for glomerular mesangial cell hypertrophy. in many renal diseases, transforming growth factor β (tgfβ)-stimulated canonical smad 3 and noncanonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) promote increased protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy. the cellular underpinnings involving these signaling molecules to regulate mesangial cell hypertrophy are not fully understood. deptor has recently been identified as an mtor interacting protein and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the kinase activity for both torc1 and torc2. prolonged incubation of mesangial cells with tgfβ reduced the levels of deptor concomitant with an increase in torc1 and torc2 activity. sustained tgfβ activation was required to inhibit association of deptor with mtor, whereas rapid activation had no effect. using the mtor inhibitor pp242, we found that tgfβ-induced both early and sustained activation of torc1 and torc2 was necessary for deptor suppression. pp242-induced reversal of deptor suppression by tgfβ was associated with a significant inhibition of tgfβ-stimulated protein synthesis and hypertrophy. interestingly, expression of sirna against smad 3 or smad 7, which blocks tgfβ receptor-specific smad 3 signaling, prevented tgfβ-induced suppression of deptor abundance and torc1/2 activities. furthermore, overexpression of smad 3 decreased deptor expression similar to tgfβ stimulation concomitant with increased torc1 and torc2 activities. finally, knockdown of deptor reversed smad 7-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy induced by tgfβ. these data reveal the requirement of both early and late activation of mtor for tgfβ-induced protein synthesis. our results support that tgfβ-stimulated smad 3 acts as a key node to instill a feedback loop between deptor down-regulation and torc1/2 activation in driving mesangial cell hypertrophy.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ affinities of venlafaxine and various reuptake inhibitors for the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. in vitro radioligand binding studies were carried out in rat brain membranes to assess the affinity of various reuptake inhibitors for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) and the norepinephrine transporters using the selective ligands [3h]cyanoimipramine and [3h]nisoxetine, respectively. the selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitors paroxetine, indalpine and fluvoxamine displayed a high affinity for the 5-ht transporter, whereas the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine had a high affinity for the norepinephrine transporter. duloxetine, a dual 5-ht and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, displayed a high affinity for both the 5-ht and the norepinephrine transporters. interestingly, venlafaxine, a dual 5-ht and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, displayed only a moderate affinity for the 5-ht transporter (ki = 74 nm) and a very low affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (ki = 1.26 microm). the relatively low affinities of venlafaxine contrast with its potent in vivo 5-ht and norepinephrine reuptake blocking properties. these results raise the possibility that the in vivo effects on the 5-ht and norepinephrine reuptake observed with venlafaxine may not be mediated solely by its binding to the [3h]cyanoimipramine and [3h]nisoxetine binding sites.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ a novel function of differentiation revealed by cdna microarray profiling of p75ntr-regulated gene expression. the expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75ntr) is diminished in epithelial cells during progression of prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro. previous studies have demonstrated a role for p75ntr as a tumor suppressor in prostate growth. to better understand the molecular mechanism of p75(ntr) on tumor suppression, we utilized a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray composed of approximately 6,000 human cancer-related genes to determine the gene expression pattern altered by re-introduction of p75ntr into pc-3 prostate tumor cells. comparison of the transcripts in the neo and p75ntr-transfected cells revealed 52 differentially expressed genes, of which 21 were up-regulated and 31 were down-regulated in the presence of p75ntr. based on the known biological functions of the p75ntr-regulated genes, we observed that p75ntr modulated the expression of genes that are critically involved in the regulation of differentiation as well as cell adhesion, signal transduction, apoptosis, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. several differentially expressed genes identified by microarray were selected for confirmation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. immunoblot analysis further confirmed increased cellular retinoic acid-binding protein i (crabpi) and igfbp5 protein levels and decreased level of plaur protein with increasing p75ntr protein expression. as crabpi was elevated far more than any other genes, we observed that the retinoids, all-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid, that bind crabpi, promoted nitroblue tetrazolium-associated functional cell differentiation in p75ntr pc-3 cells, but not in neo control pc-3 cells. subsequent examination of the retinoic acid receptors (rars) expression levels demonstrated an absence of rar-beta in the neo control cells and re-expression in the p75ntr expressing cells, consistent with previous findings where rar-beta is believed to play a critical role as a tumor suppressor gene that is lost during de-differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. whereas the rar-alpha and -gamma protein levels remained unchanged, retinoid x receptor (rxr)-alpha and -beta also exhibited increasing protein levels with re-expression of the p75ntr protein. moreover, the ability of p75ntr sirna to knockdown levels of rar-beta, rxr-alpha, and rxr-beta supports the specificity of the functional involvement of p75ntr in differentiation. hence, re-expression of the p75ntr appears to partially reverse de-differentiation of prostate cancer cells by up-regulating the expression of crabpi for localized sequestration of retinoids that are available to newly up-regulated rar-beta, rxr-alpha, and rxr-beta.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ a positron emission tomography study of quetiapine in schizophrenia: a preliminary finding of an antipsychotic effect with only transiently high dopamine d2 receptor occupancy. background: quetiapine is a new atypical antipsychotic medication. as such, relatively little has been published regarding its in vivo effects at the dopamine type 2 (d2) and serotonin type 2a (5-ht2a) receptor systems. the following study was undertaken to explore these effects across the clinical dose range and relate this information to its clinical profile. methods: twelve patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to doses of 150 to 600 mg/d (n=3, at 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) of quetiapine. after 3 weeks of treatment, d2 and 5-ht2a occupancy were measured using positron emission tomography (pet) imaging, 12 to 14 hours after the last dose. clinical efficacy and adverse effect ratings were obtained at baseline, at the time of pet scanning, and at 12 weeks. two additional patients were included to examine the effects of the drug 2 to 3 hours after last dose. results: quetiapine was an effective antipsychotic and improved the extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation noted at baseline. it achieved these results with minimal (0%-27%) d2 occupancy 12 hours after the last dose. study of the additional subjects revealed that quetiapine does give rise to transiently high (58%-64%) d2 occupancy 2 to 3 hours after a single dose that then decreases to minimal levels in 12 hours. conclusions: quetiapine shows a transiently high d2 occupancy, which decreases to very low levels by the end of the dosing interval. quetiapine's low d2 occupancy can explain its freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation. the data suggest that transient d2 occupancy may be sufficient for its antipsychotic effect. future studies controlling for nonpharmacological effects as well as activities on other receptors will be necessary to confirm this suggestion.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ a genetic program promotes c. elegans longevity at cold temperatures via a thermosensitive trp channel. both poikilotherms and homeotherms live longer at lower body temperatures, highlighting a general role of temperature reduction in lifespan extension. however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. one prominent model is that cold temperatures reduce the rate of chemical reactions, thereby slowing the rate of aging. this view suggests that cold-dependent lifespan extension is simply a passive thermodynamic process. here, we challenge this view in c. elegans by showing that genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures. we find that trpa-1, a cold-sensitive trp channel, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. this effect requires cold-induced, trpa-1-mediated calcium influx and a calcium-sensitive pkc that signals to the transcription factor daf-16/foxo. human trpa1 can functionally substitute for worm trpa-1 in promoting longevity. our results reveal a previously unrecognized function for trp channels, link calcium signaling to longevity, and, importantly, demonstrate that genetic programs contribute to lifespan extension at cold temperatures.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens by human nadh cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome b5. heterocyclic and aromatic amine carcinogens are thought to lead to tumor initiation via the formation of dna adducts, and bioactivation to arylhydroxylamine metabolites is necessary for reactivity with dna. carcinogenic arylhydroxylamine metabolites are cleared by a microsomal, nadh-dependent, oxygen-insensitive reduction pathway in humans, which may be a source of interindividual variability in response to aromatic amine carcinogens. the purpose of this study was to characterize the identity of this reduction pathway in human liver. on the basis of our findings with structurally similar arylhydroxylamine metabolites of therapeutic drugs, we hypothesized that the reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens was catalyzed by nadh cytochrome b5 reductase (b5r) and cytochrome b5 (cyt b5). we found that reduction of the carcinogenic hydroxylamines of the aromatic amine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp; found in cigarette smoke) and the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (phip; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only human b5r and cyt b5. specific activities were 56-346-fold higher in the purified system as compared to human liver microsomes (hlm), with similar michaelis-menten constants (k(m) values) in both systems. the stoichiometry for b5r and cyt b5 that yielded the highest activity in the purified system was also similar to that found in native hlm ( approximately 1:8 to 1:10). polyclonal antisera to either b5r or cyt b5 significantly inhibited n-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl (nhoh-4-abp) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual hlm was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both nhoh-4-abp and n-hydroxy-phip (nhoh-phip). finally, titration of hlm into the purified b5r/cyt b5 system did not enhance the efficiency of reduction activity. we conclude that b5r and cyt b5 are together solely capable of the reduction of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens, and we further hypothesize that this pathway may be a source of individual variability with respect to cancer susceptibility following 4-abp or phip exposure.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ plants as a source of butyrylcholinesterase variants designed for enhanced cocaine hydrolase activity. cocaine addiction affects millions of people with disastrous personal and social consequences. cocaine is one of the most reinforcing of all drugs of abuse, and even those who undergo rehabilitation and experience long periods of abstinence have more than 80% chance of relapse. yet there is no fda-approved treatment to decrease the likelihood of relapse in rehabilitated addicts. recent studies, however, have demonstrated a promising potential treatment option with the help of the serum enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (bche), which is capable of breaking down naturally occurring (-)-cocaine before the drug can influence the reward centers of the brain or affect other areas of the body. this activity of wild-type (wt) bche, however, is relatively low. this prompted the design of variants of bche which exhibit significantly improved catalytic activity against (-)-cocaine. plants are a promising means to produce large amounts of these cocaine hydrolase variants of bche, cheaply, safely with no concerns regarding human pathogens and functionally equivalent to enzymes derived from other sources. here, in expressing cocaine-hydrolyzing mutants of bche in nicotiana benthamiana using the magnicon virus-assisted transient expression system, and in reporting their initial biochemical analysis, we provide proof-of-principle that plants can express engineered bche proteins with desired properties.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ unraveling a phosphorylation event in a folded protein by nmr spectroscopy: phosphorylation of the pin1 ww domain by pka. the pin1 protein plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the hyperphosphorylated neuronal tau protein in alzheimer's disease and is by itself regulated by phosphorylation. we have used nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy to both identify the pka phosphorylation site in the pin1 ww domain and investigate the functional consequences of this phosphorylation. detection and identification of phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues in a globular protein, while mostly occurring in solvent-exposed flexible loops, does not lead to chemical shift changes as obvious as in disordered proteins and hence does not necessarily shift the resonances outside the spectrum of the folded protein. other complications were encountered to characterize the extent of the phosphorylation, as part of the (1)h,(15)n amide resonances around the phosphorylation site are specifically broadened in the unphosphorylated state. despite these obstacles, nmr spectroscopy was an efficient tool to confirm phosphorylation on s16 of the ww domain and to quantify the level of phosphorylation. based on this analytical characterization, we show that ww phosphorylation on s16 abolishes its binding capacity to a phosphorylated tau peptide. a reduced conformational heterogeneity and flexibility of the phospho-binding loop upon s16 phosphorylation could account for part of the decreased affinity for its phosphorylated partner. additionally, a structural model of the phospho-ww obtained by molecular dynamics simulation and energy minimization suggests that the phosphate moiety of phospho-s16 could compete with the phospho-substrate.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ sucralfate: the bangkok review. sucralfate is a site-protective ulcer healing drug with a remarkable range of mechanisms of action. recent studies highlight the capacity of sucralfate to bind basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) and deliver it in high concentration to the ulcer. basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates the production of granulation tissue, angiogenesis and re-epithelization, thus improving the quality of ulcer healing. the effect of sucralfate in reducing parietal cell sensitivity may be another factor important in the lower relapse rate demonstrated after duodenal ulcer healing. sucralfate has been demonstrated to be efficacious in healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers together with mild oesophagitis, and it is safe for both short-term use and maintenance. in stress ulcer prophylaxis it is as effective as acid suppression or neutralization and has the advantage of lesser rates of nosocomial pneumonia than are demonstrated with antacids or h2 antagonists. the potential advantages of sucralfate lie in the better quality of ulcer healing associated with longer duration of remission.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ effect of n-acetyl cysteine (nac), an organosulfur compound from allium plants, on experimentally induced hepatic prefibrogenic events in wistar rat. aim of present study was to investigate the effect of nac on experimental chronic hepatotoxicity models induced by carbon tetrachloride (ccl4) and thioacetamide (taa). ccl4 toxicity was induced by administering 200μl ccl4 (diluted 2:3 in coconut oil)/100g body weight, p.o., twice weekly for 8 weeks. taa toxicity was induced by administering 150mg/kg b. wt. of taa i.p., twice weekly for 8 weeks. nac treatment was started along with toxicants (ccl4 and taa) for 8 weeks and continued for further 4 weeks. self reversal group was kept without any treatment for 4 weeks after completion of toxicant treatments. alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alkaline phosphatase (alp), bilirubin were measured in serum. hydroxyproline (hp), lipid peroxidation (lpo), catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and glutathione (gsh) were determined in liver samples by colorimetric methods. cytochrome p450 2e1 (cyp 450 2e1), activity was determined as hydroxylation of aniline in liver microsomes. general examination and histological analysis were also performed. serum markers of liver damage (ast, alt, alp and bilirubin) were increased by ccl4 and taa intoxication (p<0.001), whereas co-treatment with nac reversed such changes (p<0.001). hp was enhanced in toxicant groups (p<0.001 in ccl4 and taa), but inhibited by nac (p<0.001). lpo was increased while as gsh, cat and gpx decreased by the administration of ccl4 and taa (p<0.001); co-administration of nac restored these liver markers to normal levels (p<0.001). biochemical determinations were corroborated by general and histological findings. keeping in view the biochemical and histopathological studies, it was concluded that ccl4 and taa are strong hepatotoxic agents that produce liver fibrosis with close proximity to human etiology (micronodular cirrhosis) and nac has a significant protective activity against ccl4 and taa. nac has also been validated as a model against oxidative burden in chronic liver pathology.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ topoisomerase iiβ deficiency enhances camptothecin-induced apoptosis. camptothecin (cpt), a topoisomerase (top) i-targeting drug that stabilizes top1-dna covalent adducts, can induce s-phase-specific cytotoxicity due to the arrest of progressing replication forks. however, cpt-induced non-s-phase cytotoxicity is less well characterized. in this study, we have identified topoisomerase iiβ (top2β) as a specific determinant for cpt sensitivity, but not for many other cytotoxic agents, in non-s-phase cells. first, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) lacking top2β were shown to be hypersensitive to cpt with prominent induction of apoptosis. second, icrf-187, a top2 catalytic inhibitor known to deplete top2β, specifically sensitized mefs to cpt. to explore the molecular basis for cpt hypersensitivity in top2β-deficient cells, we found that upon cpt exposure, the rna polymerase ii large subunit (rnap ls) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type mefs, whereas rnap ls remained depleted without recovery in top2β-deficient cells. concomitant with the reduction of the rnap ls level, the p53 protein level was greatly induced. interestingly, rnap ls depletion has been well documented to lead to p53-dependent apoptosis. altogether, our findings support a model in which top2β deficiency promotes cpt-induced apoptosis in quiescent non-s-phase cells, possibly due to rnap ls depletion and p53 accumulation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor in man. for more than three decades, acetaminophen (inn, paracetamol) has been claimed to be devoid of significant inhibition of peripheral prostanoids. meanwhile, attempts to explain its action by inhibition of a central cyclooxygenase (cox)-3 have been rejected. the fact that acetaminophen acts functionally as a selective cox-2 inhibitor led us to investigate the hypothesis of whether it works via preferential cox-2 blockade. ex vivo cox inhibition and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen were assessed in 5 volunteers receiving single 1000 mg doses orally. coagulation-induced thromboxane b(2) and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin e(2) were measured ex vivo and in vitro in human whole blood as indices of cox-1 and cox-2 activity. in vitro, acetaminophen elicited a 4.4-fold selectivity toward cox-2 inhibition (ic(50)=113.7 micromol/l for cox-1; ic(50)=25.8 micromol/l for cox-2). following oral administration of the drug, maximal ex vivo inhibitions were 56% (cox-1) and 83% (cox-2). acetaminophen plasma concentrations remained above the in vitro ic(50) for cox-2 for at least 5 h postadministration. ex vivo ic(50) values (cox-1: 105.2 micromol/l; cox-2: 26.3 micromol/l) of acetaminophen compared favorably with its in vitro ic(50) values. in contrast to previous concepts, acetaminophen inhibited cox-2 by more than 80%, i.e., to a degree comparable to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) and selective cox-2 inhibitors. however, a >95% cox-1 blockade relevant for suppression of platelet function was not achieved. our data may explain acetaminophen's analgesic and antiinflammatory action as well as its superior overall gastrointestinal safety profile compared with nsaids. in view of its substantial cox-2 inhibition, recently defined cardiovascular warnings for use of cox-2 inhibitors should also be considered for acetaminophen.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ molecular modeling of purinergic receptor p2y12 and interaction with its antagonists. purinergic receptors are a class of cell surface receptors for purines that prefer atp or adp over adenosine. the surface receptors for extracellular nucleotides are called p2 receptors. they are activated by both pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. adp initiates platelet aggregation by 'simultaneous activation of two g protein-coupled receptors, p2y1 and p2y12. p2y12 has been shown to be the target of the thienopyridine drugs, ticlopidine and clopidogrel. here, the active sites of p2y12 for atp as well as adp are predicted by bioinformatics and molecular modeling. first, the three-dimensional (3d) structure of p2y12 was constructed by insightii/homology module using the corresponding bovine rhodopsin (pdb code: 1hzx) as the template. then the primary structures were optimized by energy minimization that has been successfully accepted by the protein data bank (pdb code: 1vz1). second, a simple scoring matrix was built up based on the analysis of 13 known atp-binding proteins. and the most probable active sites of p2y12 were predicted using the scoring matrix, which include three distant areas: "head area" (lgtgplrtfv, 87-96), "middle area" (vglitnglam, 38-47, and lgakilsvvi, 139-148), and "bottom area" (rtrgvgkvpr, 222-231). subsequently the structural model of p2y12 was docked with atp/adp in comparison with p2y1 (pdb code 1ddd). as a comparison, we docked its antagonists, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, to the most probable sites and calculated their intermolecular energy. our results imply that p2y12 has the potential to be inhibited by adp/atp analogs, and it suggests that p2y12 acts as a target of new drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ crystal structure of the il-2 signaling complex: paradigm for a heterotrimeric cytokine receptor. il-2 is a cytokine that functions as a growth factor and central regulator in the immune system and mediates its effects through ligand-induced hetero-trimerization of the receptor subunits il-2r alpha, il-2r beta, and gamma(c). here, we describe the crystal structure of the trimeric assembly of the human il-2 receptor ectodomains in complex with il-2 at 3.0 a resolution. the quaternary structure is consistent with a stepwise assembly from il-2/il-2r alpha to il-2/il-2r alpha/il-2r beta to il-2/il-2r alpha/il-2r beta/gamma(c). the il-2r alpha subunit forms the largest of the three il-2/il-2r interfaces, which, together with the high abundance of charge-charge interactions, correlates well with the rapid association rate and high-affinity interaction of il-2r alpha with il-2 at the cell surface. surprisingly, il-2r alpha makes no contacts with il-2r beta or gamma(c), and only minor changes are observed in the il-2 structure in response to receptor binding. these findings support the principal role of il-2r alpha to deliver il-2 to the signaling complex and act as regulator of signal transduction. cooperativity in assembly of the final quaternary complex is easily explained by the extraordinarily extensive set of interfaces found within the fully assembled il-2 signaling complex, which nearly span the entire length of the il-2r beta and gamma(c) subunits. helix a of il-2 wedges tightly between il-2r beta and gamma(c) to form a three-way junction that coalesces into a composite binding site for the final gamma(c) recruitment. the il-2/gamma(c) interface itself exhibits the smallest buried surface and the fewest hydrogen bonds in the complex, which is consistent with its promiscuous use in other cytokine receptor complexes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ estimation of warfarin maintenance dose based on vkorc1 (-1639 g>a) and cyp2c9 genotypes. background: cyp2c9 polymorphisms are associated with decreased s-warfarin clearance and lower maintenance dosage. decreased expression of vkorc1 resulting from the -1639g>a substitution has also been implicated in lower warfarin dose requirements. we investigated the additional contribution of this polymorphism to the variance in warfarin dose. methods: sixty-five patients with stable anticoagulation were genotyped for cyp2c9 and vkorc1 with tag-it allele-specific primer extension technology. plasma s-warfarin concentrations and warfarin maintenance dose were compared among patients on the basis of the vkorc1 -1639g>a genotype. results: eighty percent of cyp2c9*1/*1 patients stabilized on <4.0 mg/day warfarin had at least 1 vkorc1 -1639a allele. mean warfarin doses (sd) were 6.7 (3.3), 4.3 (2.2), and 2.7 (1.2) mg/day for patients with the vkorc1 -1639gg, ga, and aa genotypes, respectively. steady-state plasma concentrations of s-warfarin were lowest in patients with the vkorc1 -1639aa genotype and demonstrated a positive association with the vkorc1 -1639g allele copy number (trend p = 0.012). a model including vkorc1 and cyp2c9 genotypes, age, sex, and body weight accounted for 61% of the variance in warfarin daily maintenance dose. conclusions: the vkorc1 -1639a allele accounts for low dosage requirements of most patients without a cyp2c9 variant. higher plasma s-warfarin concentrations corresponding to increased warfarin maintenance dosages support a hypothesis for increased expression of the vkorc1 -1639g allele. vkorc1 and cyp2c9 genotypes, age, sex, and body weight account for the majority of variance in warfarin dose among our study population.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ endothelial nitric oxide production is tightly coupled to the citrulline-no cycle. nitric oxide (no) is an important vasorelaxant produced along with l-citrulline from l-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos). previous studies suggested that the recycling of l-citrulline to l-arginine is essential for no production in endothelial cells. however, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the degree to which the recycling of l-citrulline to l-arginine is coupled to no production. we hypothesized that the amount of no formed would be significantly higher than the amount of l-citrulline formed due to the efficiency of l-citrulline recycling via the citrulline-no cycle. to test this hypothesis, endothelial cells were incubated with [14c]-l-arginine and stimulated by various agents to produce no. the extent of no and [14c]-l-citrulline formation were simultaneously determined. no production exceeded apparent l-citrulline formation of the order of 8 to 1, under both basal and stimulated conditions. as further support, alpha-methyl-dl-aspartate, an inhibitor of argininosuccinate synthase (as), a component of the citrulline-no cycle, inhibited no production in a dose-dependent manner. the results of this study provide evidence for the essential and efficient coupling of l-citrulline recycling, via the citrulline-no cycle, to endothelial no production.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ conformational transitions linked to active site ligation in human thrombin: effect on the interaction with fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor. an experimental strategy based on solution viscosity perturbation allowed us to study the energetics of amide-substrates, p-aminobenzamidine (p-abz) and proflavin binding to the catalytic site of two proteolyzed forms of alpha-thrombin, i.e. zeta- and gamma t-thrombin. these thrombin derivatives are cleaved at the leu144-gly150 loop and at the fibrinogen recognition exosite (frs), respectively. a phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the amide substrates and p-abz interactions with zeta-thrombin were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity). the latter was slightly lower than that previously observed for a alpha-thrombin (0.78 +/- 0.25 versus 1.01 +/- 0.17 kcal/mol k). both phenomenon were absent in gamma t-thrombin. the interaction of a alpha-, zeta- and gamma t-thrombin with macromolecular substrates that "bridge-bind" to both the catalytic site (cs) and fibrinogen recognition exosite (frs), such as fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor (cpr), was also evaluated. these interactions were studied by following fibrinopeptide a (fpa) release and by measuring intraplatelet ca2+ changes induced by thrombin-cpr interaction. it was found that the free energy of activation (rt ln kcat/km) for both fibrinogen and cpr hydrolysis followed the same hierarchy, i.e. alpha > zeta > gamma. moreover, the values of delta cp for alpha-, zeta- and gamma t-thrombin interaction with p-abz were found to be linearly correlated to the free energy of activation for both fibrinogen and cpr cleavage. in conclusion, these data demonstrate that: (1) the leu144-gly150 loop and the frs are both involved in the conformational transition linked to the binding of p-aminobenzamidine to the thrombin active site; (2) the extent of thrombin's capacity to undergo conformational transitions in alpha-, zeta- and gamma t forms is positively correlated to the free energy of activation for hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates interacting with both the catalytic domain and the frs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ [pharmacological effects of a mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone on alcohol dependence]. alcohol is one of the most commonly abused substances, and its chronic intake leads to the development of ethanol dependence in both humans and laboratory animals. in many countries, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone has been used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. the introduction of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence has been mainly based on behavioral animal models that provide evidence of the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in alcohol drinking and dependence. it has been well known that alcohol leads to the activation of the endogenous opioid system. the endogenous opioid agonists, such as beta-endorphin, increase the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system through the inhibition of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)-containing inhibitory interneurons in the ventral tegmental area, resulting in the expression of alcohol reinforcement and/or rewarding effect. therefore, naltrexone, which is useful for alcohol dependence therapy, may attenuate the rewarding effect of ethanol by interfering with the ethanol-induced stimulation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. the following review provides a summary of the interactions between endogenous opioid system and mesolimbic dopaminergic system in alcohol dependence.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated ventricular tachycardia to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine. evidence for myocardial receptor-mediated effects. background: reentrant ventricular tachycardia (vt) is known to be insensitive to the nucleoside adenosine. however, we have previously identified a form of nonreentrant, catecholamine-mediated vt that can be initiated with rapid pacing, demonstrates cycle length dependence, and is sensitive to exogenous adenosine as well as to the valsalva maneuver. the mechanism of this tachycardia is thought to be due to a catecholamine-induced, camp-mediated increase in intracellular calcium, resulting in delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. the antiarrhythmic effects of exogenous adenosine and valsalva on this form of vt may be due to receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or to noncardiac receptor-mediated effects, i.e., exogenous adenosine may modulate vt through alterations in autonomic tone by activation of arterial chemoreceptors, and valsalva has been shown to decrease venous return, resulting in a reduction in cardiac dimensions and myocardial stretch. to clarify this issue and circumvent both autonomic and noncardiac receptor effects, the response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated vt to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine was evaluated. methods and results: group 1 (n = 8): dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg i.v.), a nucleoside transport blocker that potentiates the effects of endogenous adenosine, reproducibly abolished sustained nonreentrant, nonautomatic, catecholamine-mediated vt in the five patients in whom it was evaluated. vt recurred with the addition of aminophylline, a competitive adenosine a1-receptor antagonist. edrophonium (10 mg i.v.), a cholinesterase inhibitor that potentiates the effects of acetylcholine at the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, terminated vt in four of four patients, an effect that was reversed by atropine. group 2 (n = 6): in patients with reentrant vt, dipyridamole and edrophonium had no effect on vt cycle length or duration. group 3 (n = 4): adenosine and vagal maneuvers had no effect on catecholamine-mediated vt caused by automaticity in three of four patients tested. in one patient, adenosine transiently suppressed vt (< 5 seconds), after which it spontaneously resumed. conclusions: the results of this study further delineate the mechanism of a newly recognized form of clinical vt. it can be identified by termination of the tachycardia in response to activation of the adenosine a1 or muscarinic cholinergic receptor, which results in inhibition of adenylate cyclase. these receptor-mediated effects appear to be specific for identifying nonreentrant, nonautomatic, catecholamine-mediated vt.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ transcriptional control of the arginine/lysine transporter, cat-1, by physiological stress. cells respond to physiological stress by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor eif2. this adaptive response inhibits protein synthesis and up-regulates genes essential for cell survival. cat-1, the transporter for the essential amino acids, arginine and lysine, is one of the up-regulated genes. we previously showed that stress increases cat-1 expression by coordinated stabilization of the mrna and increased mrna translation. this induction is triggered by amino acid depletion and the unfolded protein response (upr), which is caused by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. we show here that cat-1 gene transcription is also increased by cellular stress. our studies demonstrate that the cat-1 gene promoter/regulatory region is tata-less and is located in a region that includes 94 bases of the first exon. transcription from this promoter is stimulated 8-fold by cellular stress. an amino acid response element within the first exon is shown to be required for the response to amino acid depletion but not to the upr. the stimulation of transcription by amino acid depletion requires activation of gcn2 kinase, which phosphorylates eif2alpha. this phosphorylation also induces translation of the cat-1 mrna, demonstrating that stress-induced transcriptional and translational control of cat-1 are downstream targets of a signaling pathway initiating with eif2alpha phosphorylation. our studies show that the increase in cat-1 gene expression by cellular stress involves at least three types of coordinate regulation: regulation of transcription, regulation of mrna stability, and regulation of mrna translation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ involvement of cox-1 and up-regulated prostaglandin e synthases in phosphatidylserine liposome-induced prostaglandin e2 production by microglia. after engulfment of apoptotic cells through phosphatidylserine (ps)-mediated recognition, microglia secrete prostaglandin e2 (pge2), a potent anti-inflammatory molecule in the central nervous system. despite the clinical significance, the mechanism underlying pge2 production by phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is poorly understood. in the present study, we used ps liposomes to elucidate the phagocytic pathway for pge2 production in microglia, because ps liposomes mimic the effects of apoptotic cells on microglia/macrophages. the level of pge2 in the culture medium of primary cultured rat microglia was significantly increased by ps liposomes treatment but not by phosphatidylcholine liposomes treatment. the specific ligand for class b scavenger receptor (sr-b), high density lipoprotein, significantly suppressed ps liposome-induced pge2 production. ps liposomes were immediately phagocytosed by microglia and sorted to endosomes/lysosomes. cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 and membrane-bound prostaglandin e synthase-1 (mpges-1) were induced by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (lps) but not with ps liposomes. on the other hand, mpges-2 and cytosolic pges (cpges) that are functionally coupled with cox-1 were upregulated after treatment with ps liposomes or lps. furthermore, ps liposome-induced pge2 production was significantly suppressed by indomethacin, a preferential cox-1 inhibitor, but not by ns-398, a selective cox-2 inhibitor. ps liposomes induced activation of p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in sr-bi independent manner. these observations strongly suggest that the up-regulation of terminal pgess that are preferentially coupled with cox-1, especially mpges-2, plays the pivotal role in ps liposome-induced pge2 production by microglia. although sr-bi plays an essential role in ps liposome-induced pge2 production, other ps-recognizing receptors, possibly ps-specific receptor, could also promote pge2 production by transducing intracellular signals including p44/p42 erk after ps liposomes treatment.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ h3 histamine receptor agonist inhibits biliary growth of bdl rats by downregulation of the camp-dependent pka/erk1/2/elk-1 pathway. histamine regulates many functions by binding to four histamine g-coupled receptor proteins (h1r, h2r, h3r and h4r). as h3r exerts their effects by coupling to galpha(i/o) proteins reducing adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (camp) levels (a key player in the modulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia/damage), we evaluated the role of h3r in the regulation of biliary growth. we posed the following questions: (1) do cholangiocytes express h3r? (2) does in vivo administration of (r)-(alpha)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (ramh) (h3r agonist), thioperamide maleate (h3r antagonist) or histamine, in the absence/presence of thioperamide maleate, to bile duct ligated (bdl) rats regulate cholangiocyte proliferation? and (3) does ramh inhibit cholangiocyte proliferation by downregulation of camp-dependent phosphorylation of protein kinase a (pka)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2)/ets-like gene-1 (elk-1)? the expression of h3r was evaluated in liver sections by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, and by real-time pcr in cholangiocyte rna from normal and bdl rats. bdl rats (immediately after bdl) were treated daily with ramh, thioperamide maleate or histamine in the absence/presence of thioperamide maleate for 1 week. following in vivo treatment of bdl rats with ramh for 1 week, and in vitro stimulation of bdl cholangiocytes with ramh, we evaluated cholangiocyte proliferation, camp levels and pka, erk1/2 and elk-1 phosphorylation. cholangiocytes from normal and bdl rats express h3r. the expression of h3r mrna increased in bdl compared to normal cholangiocytes. histamine decreased cholangiocyte growth of bdl rats to a lower extent than that observed in bdl ramh-treated rats; histamine-induced inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was partly blocked by thioperamide maleate. in bdl rats treated with thioperamide maleate, cholangiocyte hyperplasia was slightly higher than that of bdl rats. in vitro, ramh inhibited the proliferation of bdl cholangiocytes. ramh inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was associated with decreased camp levels and pka/erk1/2/elk-1 phosphorylation. downregulation of camp-dependent pka/erk1/2/elk-1 phosphorylation (by activation of h3r) is important in the inhibition of cholangiocyte growth in liver diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ analysis of plasmin binding and urokinase activation of plasminogen bound to the heymann nephritis autoantigen, gp330. previously, we demonstrated that the heymann nephritis autoantigen, gp330, can serve as a receptor site for plasminogen. this binding was not significantly inhibited by the lysine analogue epsilon-amino caproic acid (eaca), indicating that plasminogen binding was not just through lysine binding sites as suggested for other plasminogen binding sites. we now report that once plasminogen is bound to gp330, it can be converted to its active form of plasmin by urokinase. this conversion of plasminogen to plasmin proceeds at a faster rate when plasminogen is first prebound to gp330. although there is a proportional increase in the vmax of the urokinase-catalyzed reaction with increasing gp330 concentrations, no change in km was observed. once activated, plasmin remains bound to gp330 in an active state capable of cleaving the chromogenic tripeptide, s-2251. the binding of plasmin to gp330 did not significantly change its enzymatic activity; however, gp330 did have a stabilizing effect on plasmin activity at 37 degrees c. while bound to gp330, plasmin is protected from inactivation by its natural inhibitor alpha 2-antiplasmin. the binding of plasmin to gp330 as analyzed by elisa was shown to be time dependent, reversible, saturable, and specific for gp330. inhibition of binding of both plasminogen and plasmin to gp330 by benzamidine was similar, although eaca inhibited the binding of plasmin to gp330 slightly more than the binding of plasminogen to gp330. these results indicate that the binding of plasminogen to gp330 serves as an effective means of increasing the rate of plasmin production on the glomerular and tubular epithelial cell surface while protecting the active plasmin from natural inhibitors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ annexin a2 regulates β1 integrin internalization and intestinal epithelial cell migration. the gastrointestinal epithelium functions as an important barrier that separates luminal contents from the underlying tissue compartment and is vital in maintaining mucosal homeostasis. mucosal wounds in inflammatory disorders compromise the critical epithelial barrier. in response to injury, intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) rapidly migrate to reseal wounds. we have previously observed that a membrane associated, actin binding protein, annexin a2 (anxa2), is up-regulated in migrating iecs and plays an important role in promoting wound closure. to identify the mechanisms by which anxa2 promotes iec movement and wound closure we used a loss of function approach. anxa2 specific shrna was utilized to generate iecs with stable down-regulation of anxa2. loss of anxa2 inhibited iec migration while promoting enhanced cell-matrix adhesion. these functional effects were associated with increased levels of β1 integrin protein, which is reported to play an important role in mediating the cell-matrix adhesive properties of epithelial cells. since cell migration requires dynamic turnover of integrin based adhesions, we tested if anxa2 modulates internalization of cell surface β1 integrin required for forward cell movement. indeed, pulse-chase biotinylation experiments in iecs lacking anxa2 demonstrated a significant increase in cell surface β1 integrin that was accompanied by decreased β1 integrin internalization and degradation. these findings support an important role of anxa2 in controlling dynamics of β1 integrin at the cell surface that in turn is required for the active turnover of cell-matrix associations, cell migration and wound closure.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ locally administered prostaglandin e2 prevents aeroallergen-induced airway sensitization in mice through immunomodulatory mechanisms. prostaglandin e2 attenuates airway pathology in asthmatic patients and exerts a protective effect in antigen-sensitized mice when administered systemically. we aimed to establish the consequences of intranasal pge2 administration on airway reactivity to aeroallergens in mice and reveal the underlying immunoinflammatory mechanisms. pge2 was administered either daily during a 10-day exposure to house dust mite (hdm) extracts or for limited intervals. airway hyperreactivity was measured by whole-body and invasive plethysmography. the phenotypes of lung immune cells and cytokine production were analysed by flow cytometry and elisa, respectively. airway hyperreactivity was sustainably reduced only when pge2 administration was restricted to the initial 5 days of exposure to hdm. lung inflammation, il-4 production, and airway mast cell activity were also prevented under this early short-term treatment with pge2. interestingly, a th2 response was already committed on day 5 of exposure to hdm. this was paralleled by gm-csf and osteopontin upregulation and a decreased number of plasmacytoid dendritic and t regulatory cells, as well as a trend towards reduced il-10 expression. local pge2 administration prevented the increase of airway il-13 and osteopontin and kept lung plasmacytoid dendritic cell counts close to baseline. gm-csf and tregs were unaffected by the treatment. these findings suggest that the protection provided by pge2 is a result of the modulation of early lung immunomodulatory mechanisms, and possibly a shift in the balance of dendritic cells towards a tolerogenic profile.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ conversion of 5-aminolevulinate synthase into a more active enzyme by linking the two subunits: spectroscopic and kinetic properties. the two active sites of dimeric 5-aminolevulinate synthase (alas), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme, are located on the subunit interface with contribution of essential amino acids from each subunit. linking the two subunits into a single polypeptide chain dimer (2xalas) yielded an enzyme with an approximate sevenfold greater turnover number than that of wild-type alas. spectroscopic and kinetic properties of 2xalas were investigated to explore the differences in the coenzyme structure and kinetic mechanism relative to those of wild-type alas that confer a more active enzyme. the absorption spectra of both alas and 2xalas had maxima at 410 and 330 nm, with a greater a(410)/a(330) ratio at ph approximately 7.5 for 2xalas. the 330 nm absorption band showed an intense fluorescence at 385 nm but not at 510 nm, indicating that the 330 nm absorption species is the substituted aldamine rather than the enolimine form of the schiff base. the 385 nm emission intensity increased with increasing ph with a single pk of approximately 8.5 for both enzymes, and thus the 410 and 330 nm absorption species were attributed to the ketoenamine and substituted aldamine, respectively. transient kinetic analysis of the formation and decay of the quinonoid intermediate eq(2) indicated that, although their rates were similar in alas and 2xalas, accumulation of this intermediate was greater in the 2xalas-catalyzed reaction. collectively, these results suggest that ketoenamine is the active form of the coenzyme and forms a more prominent coenzyme structure in 2xalas than in alas at ph approximately 7.5.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ chalcogenopyrylium dyes as differential modulators of organic anion transport by mrp1, mrp2 and mrp4. multidrug resistance proteins (mrps) mediate the atp-dependent efflux of structurally diverse compounds, including anticancer drugs and physiological organic anions. five classes of chalcogenopyrylium dyes (cgps) were examined for their ability to modulate transport of [(3)h]estradiol glucuronide (e217βg) (a prototypical mrp substrate) into mrp-enriched inside-out membrane vesicles. additionally, some cgps were tested in intact transfected cells using a calcein efflux assay. sixteen of 34 cgps inhibited mrp1-mediated e217βg uptake by >50% (ic50's 0.7-7.6 μm). of 9 cgps with ic50's ≤2 μm, two belonged to class i, two to class iii and five to class v. when tested in the intact cells, only 4 of 16 cgps (at 10 μm) inhibited mrp1-mediated calcein efflux by >50% (iii-1, v-3, -4, -6) while a fifth (i-5) inhibited efflux by just 23%. these five cgps also inhibited [(3)h]e217βg uptake by mrp4. in contrast, their effects on mrp2 varied with two (v-4, v-6) inhibiting e217βg transport (ic50's 2.0, 9.2 μm), two (v-3, iii-1) stimulating transport (>2-fold), while cgp i-5 had no effect. strikingly, although v-3 and v-4 had opposite effects on mrp2 activity, they are structurally identical except for their chalcogen atom (se versus te). this study is the first to identify class v cgps with their distinctive methine or trimethine linkage between two disubstituted pyrylium moieties as a particularly potent class of mrp modulators and also show that within this core structure, differences in the electronegativity associated with a chalcogen atom can be the sole determinant of whether a compound will stimulate or inhibit mrp2.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cross-talk between constitutive androstane receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor in the regulation of gene expression. hypoxia inducible factor (hif) and 5'-amp-activated protein kinase are often activated under similar physiological conditions. constitutive androstane receptor (car) translocates into the nucleus in accordance with 5'-amp-activated protein kinase and thus confers transactivation. the aim of the present study was to investigate a possible link between car and hifα. phenobarbital (pb), a typical car activator, increased the gene expression of hif-target genes in the livers of mice, including erythropoietin, heme oxygenase-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-a. pb induced an accumulation of nuclear hif-1α and an increase in the hif-responsive element-mediated transactivation in hepg2 cells. cobalt chloride, a typical hif activator, induced the gene expression of car-target genes, including cyp2b9 and cyp2b10, an accumulation of nuclear car and an increase in the pb-responsive enhancer module-mediated transactivation in the mouse liver. immunoprecipitation-immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that car binds to the pb-responsive enhancer module with hif-1α in the liver of untreated mice and that the complex dissociates upon pb treatment. taken together these results suggest that car and hif-α interact and reciprocally modulate the functions of each other.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ artificial sweeteners and salts producing a metallic taste sensation activate trpv1 receptors. throughout the world many people use artificial sweeteners (as) for the purpose of reducing caloric intake. the most prominently used of these molecules include saccharin, aspartame (nutrasweet), acesulfame-k, and cyclamate. despite the caloric advantage they provide, one key concern in their use is their aversive aftertaste that has been characterized on a sensory level as bitter and/or metallic. recently, it has been shown that the activation of particular t2r bitter taste receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of saccharin and acesulfame-k. to more fully understand the biology behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether as could stimulate transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (trpv1) receptors, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. moreover, trpv1 receptors and/or their variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals throughout the oral cavity. hence, trpv1 activation could be involved in the as aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood metallic taste sensation. using ca(2+) imaging on trpv1 receptors heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both systems, as activate trpv1 receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize these channels to acid and heat. we also found that trpv1 receptors are activated by cuso(4), znso(4), and feso(4), three salts known to produce a metallic taste sensation. in summary, our results identify a novel group of compounds that activate trpv1 and, consequently, provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ polyamine depletion delays apoptosis of rat intestinal epithelial cells. the polyamines spermidine, spermine, and their precursor putrescine are essential for cell growth and the regulation of the cell cycle. recent studies suggest that excessive accumulation of polyamines favors either malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the stimulus. this study examines the involvement of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the dna topoisomerase i inhibitor, camptothecin. in iec-6 cells, camptothecin induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. detached cells showed dna laddering and caspase 3 induction, characteristic features of apoptosis. depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine by dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (dfmo), a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (odc) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in caspase 3 activity in polyamine-depleted cells. addition of putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and caspase 3 activity. polyamine depletion did not change the level of caspase 3 protein. inhibition of s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); degbg] led to depletion of spermidine and spermine with a significant accumulation of putrescine and induction of odc. the degbg-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. addition of putrescine to dfmo-treated cell extracts did not increase caspase 3 activity. the above results indicate that polyamine depletion delays the onset of apoptosis in iec-6 cells and confers protection against dna damaging agents, suggesting that polyamines might be involved in the caspase activating signal cascade.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduces na(+) influx into cortical synaptosomes by direct interaction with na(+) channels: comparison with other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist used for the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. in this study, we examined whether betaxolol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (na(+) channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. betaxolol inhibited specific [(3)h]-batrachotoxinin-a 20-alpha-benzoate ([(3)h]-btx-b) binding to neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an ic(50) value of 9.8 microm. comparison of all the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol>betaxolol approximately levobetaxolol>levobunolol approximately carteolol>/=timolol>atenolol. none of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of [(3)h]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 microm. saturation experiments showed that betaxolol increased the k(d) of [(3)h]-btx-b binding but had no effect on the b(max). the association kinetics of [(3)h]-btx-b were unaffected by betaxolol, but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. these findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [(3)h]-btx-b binding by betaxolol. betaxolol inhibited veratridine-stimulated na(+) influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an ic(50) value of 28. 3 microm. carteolol, levobunolol, timolol and atenolol were significantly less effective than betaxolol at reducing veratridine-evoked na(+) influx. the ability of betaxolol to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the na(+) channel and inhibit na(+) influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ mechanisms limiting distribution of the threonine-protein kinase b-raf(v600e) inhibitor dabrafenib to the brain: implications for the treatment of melanoma brain metastases. brain metastases are a common cause of death in stage iv metastatic melanoma. dabrafenib is a braf (gene encoding serine/threonine-protein kinase b-raf) inhibitor that has been developed to selectively target the valine 600 to glutamic acid substitution (braf(v600e)), which is commonly found in metastatic melanoma. clinical trials with dabrafenib have shown encouraging results; however, the central nervous system distribution of dabrafenib remains unknown. thus, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the brain distribution of dabrafenib in mice, and to see whether active efflux by p-glycoprotein (p-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) restricts its delivery across the blood-brain barrier (bbb). in vitro accumulation studies conducted in madin-darby canine kidney ii cells indicate that dabrafenib is an avid substrate for both p-gp and bcrp. directional flux studies revealed greater transport in the basolateral to apical direction with corrected efflux ratios greater than 2 for both p-gp and bcrp1 transfected cell lines. in vivo, the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (auc)(brain) to auc(plasma) (k(p)) of dabrafenib after an i.v. dose (2.5 mg/kg) was 0.023, which increased by 18-fold in mdr1 a/b(-/-)bcrp1(-/-) mice to 0.42. dabrafenib plasma exposure was ∼2-fold greater in mdr1 a/b(-/-)bcrp1(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type with an oral dose (25 mg/kg); however, the brain distribution was increased by ~10-fold with a resulting k(p) of 0.25. further, compared with vemurafenib, another braf(v600e) inhibitor, dabrafenib showed greater brain penetration with a similar dose. in conclusion, the dabrafenib brain distribution is limited in an intact bbb model, and the data presented herein may have clinical implications in the prevention and treatment of melanoma brain metastases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ terbinafine: mode of action and properties of the squalene epoxidase inhibition. terbinafine (lamisil) has primarily fungicidal action against many fungi as a result of its specific mechanism of squalene epoxidase inhibition. treated fungi accumulate squalene while becoming deficient in ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. the cidal action is closely associated with the development of high intracellular squalene concentrations, which are believed to interfere with fungal membrane function and cell wall synthesis. in the case of candida albicans, growth inhibition with terbinafine appears to result from the ergosterol deficiency. the filamentous form of this fungus is more susceptible than the yeast form. measurement of ergosterol biosynthesis by incorporation of radiolabelled precursors indicates a correlation between inhibition of growth and ergosterol biosynthesis in a range of pathogenic fungi. terbinafine is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of squalene epoxidase from candida (ki = 30 nm). in contrast, inhibition of rat liver squalene epoxidase only occurs at higher drug concentrations (ki = 77 microm), and is competitive with squalene. thus, terbinafine has no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo. squalene epoxidase is not an enzyme of the cytochrome p-450 type, thereby avoiding potential inhibition of this class of enzymes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ effect of ifenprodil on glun1/glun2b n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor gating. ifenprodil is an allosteric inhibitor of glun1/glun2b n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. despite its widespread use as a prototype for drug development and a subtype-selective tool for physiologic experiments, its precise effect on glun1/glun2b gating is yet to be fully understood. interestingly, recent crystallographic evidence identified that ifenprodil, unlike zinc, binds at the interface of the glun1/glun2b amino terminal domain dimer by an induced-fit mechanism. to delineate the effect of this unique binding on glun1/glun2b receptor gating, we recorded steady-state currents from cell-attached and outside-out patches. at ph 7.9 in cell-attached patches, ifenprodil increased the occupancy of the long-lived shut conformations, thereby reducing the open probability of the receptor with no change in the mean open time. in addition, ifenprodil selectively affected the area of shut time constants, but not the time constants themselves. kinetic analyses suggested that ifenprodil prevents the transition of the receptor to an open state and increases its dwell time in an intrinsically occurring closed conformation or desensitized state. we found distinct differences in the action of ifenprodil at glun1/glun2b in comparison with previous studies on the effect of zinc on glun1/glun2a gating, which may arise due to their unique binding sites. our data also uncover the potential ph-dependent action of ifenprodil on gating. at a low ph (ph 7.4), but not ph 7.9, ifenprodil reduces the mean open time of glun1/glun2b receptors, which may be responsible for its usefulness as a context-dependent inhibitor in conditions like ischemia and stroke, when the ph of the extracellular milieu becomes acidic.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ medical therapy and quality of life. the risk of mortality and long-term morbidity, including loss of sexual function, associated with surgical procedures for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) has prompted research into alternative medical therapies. phytotherapy involves the use of herbal formulations, where the mechanisms of action are usually obscure and although studies have confirmed their effectiveness in symptom relief and improving quality of life (qol), few placebo-controlled trials exist. both the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. alfuzosin, doxazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin and terazosin) have been recommended as appropriate treatment options for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) associated with benign prostatic obstruction (bpo), and their efficacy has been proven in several placebo-controlled trials. finasteride reduces the static component of bpo--by reducing the size of the prostate--and, as a result, symptom relief is slow (6-12 months) and is predominantly restricted to patients with large prostates (> 40 g). the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, on the other hand, reduce the dynamic component of obstruction--relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate, urethra and bladder neck--and provide rapid symptom relief after only a few doses, relieving luts more effectively than finasteride and irrespective of prostate size. all of the various alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists provide effective and comparable relief of luts, and an improvement in bothersomeness and symptom-related qol. however, it is also important that the therapy is fast acting and acceptable to the patient, in that it does not interfere with other medication or produce unpleasant side effects. these documented properties of the alpha 1a-adrenoceptor antagonists make them an ideal choice for the medical treatment of symptomatic bph.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and thereby induces osteoprotegerin gene expression in osteoblast-like cell lines. sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) is a well-known signaling sphingolipid and bioactive lipid mediator. recently, it was reported that s1p inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. on the other hand, s1p effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. in this study, we investigated the effects of s1p on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, saos-2 and mc3t3-e1. s1p activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by β-catenin/t-cell factor complex formation in both saos-2 cells and mc3t3-e1 cells. the inhibitors of pi3k and akt suppressed s1p-induced nuclear localization of β-catenin. we further investigated the effects of pi3k/akt signaling on the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, since β-catenin takes a central role in this signaling pathway. both inhibitors for pi3k and akt suppressed the nuclear localization of β-catenin and t-cell factor transcriptional activity induced by wnt-3a. s1p increased the amount of osteoprotegerin at both mrna and protein levels, and increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, leading to the mineralization. these findings suggest that s1p activates the pi3k/akt signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of β-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ immunomodulatory properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and allergic patients. in the present study, we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (mwcnts) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy donors and mite-allergic subjects. freshly prepared pbmcs, stimulated or not with toll-like receptor (tlr)1-9 agonists, a t cell mitogen (phytohemagglutinin a) or mite allergen extract were cultured in the presence or absence of mwcnts. secretion of tnf-α, il-2, il-5, il-6, il-12/23p40 or ifn-γ was quantified in the culture supernatants by elisa. basal secretion of all the cytokines was not altered by mwcnts in pbmcs from both healthy donors and allergic subjects. in pbmcs from healthy donors, tnf-α, il-6 and il-12/23p40 secretion in response to the tlr4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide was however increased in a dose-dependent manner by mwcnts. significant increases in the release of these cytokines were also observed in pbmcs stimulated with a tlr2 or tlr3 agonist. mwcnts also increased the release of il-2 and ifn-γ by pbmcs stimulated with a t cell mitogen. in contrast, mwcnts inhibited allergen-induced il-5 secretion by pbmcs from mite-allergic subjects. as well, mwcnts altered the capacity of pbmc-derived monocytes to differentiate into functional dendritic cells. all together, our data suggest that according to its immune cell target, mwcnts may either promote or suppress immune responses in humans. further investigations are necessary to fully understand the complexity behind interactions of engineered nanoparticles with the immune system.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ atypical neuroleptics have low affinity for dopamine d2 receptors or are selective for d4 receptors. this review examines the possible receptor basis of the atypical action of those atypical antipsychotic drugs that elicit low levels of parkinsonism. such an examination requires consistent and accurate dissociation constants for the antipsychotic drugs at the relevant dopamine and serotonin receptors. it has long been known, however, that the dissociation constant of a given antipsychotic drug at the dopamine d2 receptor varies between laboratories. although such variation depends on several factors, it has recently been recognized that the radioligand used to measure the competition between the antipsychotic drug and the radioligand is an important variable. the present review summarizes information on this radioligand dependence. in general, a radioligand of low solubility in the membrane (i.e., low tissue:buffer partition) results in a low value for the antipsychotic dissociation constant when the drug competes with the radioligand. hence, by first obtaining the antipsychotic dissociation constants using different radioligands of different solubility in the membrane, one can then extrapolate the data to low or "zero" ligand solubility. the extrapolated value represents the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of the antipsychotic. these values are here given for dopamine d2 and d4 receptors, as well as for serotonin 5-ht2a receptors. these values, moreover, agree with the dissociation constant directly obtained with the radioactive antipsychotic itself. for example, clozapine revealed a radioligand-independent value of 1.6 nm at the dopamine d4 receptor, agreeing with the value directly measured with [3h]-clozapine at d4. however, because clozapine competes with endogenous dopamine, the in vivo concentration of clozapine (to occupy dopamine d4 receptors) can be derived to be about 13 nm, agreeing with the value of 12 to 20 nm in the plasma water or spinal fluid observed in treated patients. the atypical neuroleptics remoxipride, clozapine, perlapine, seroquel, and melperone had low affinity for the dopamine d2 receptor (radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 30 to 90 nm). such low affinity makes these latter five drugs readily displaceable by high levels of endogenous dopamine in the caudate or putamen. most typical neuroleptics have radioligand-independent values of 0.3 to 5 nm at dopamine d2 receptors, making them more resistant to displacement by endogenous dopamine. finally, a relation was found between the neuroleptic doses for rat catalepsy and the d2:d4 ratio of the radioligand-independent k values for these two receptors. thus, the atypical neuroleptics appear to fall into two groups, those that have a low affinity for dopamine d2 receptors and those that are selective for dopamine d4 receptors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ocular beta-blockers in glaucoma management. clinical pharmacological aspects. topical beta-blockers reduce the intraocular pressure (iop) by blockade of sympathetic nerve endings in the ciliary epithelium causing a fall in aqueous humour production. two types of topical beta-blockers are available for use in glaucoma: nonselective, which block both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors; and cardioselective, which block only beta 1-receptors. of the beta-blockers commercially available, timolol, levobunolol, metipranolol and carteolol are nonselective, and betaxolol is cardioselective. twice-daily timolol is probably the most effective agent in lowering iop, although levobunolol is equally effective and can be used once daily with little difference in effect. carteolol is used twice daily and any theoretical advantage in diminished side effects conferred by its partial beta-agonist activity compared with timolol has not been fully substantiated. metipranolol is effective twice daily and does not have partial beta-agonist activity. betaxolol has an effect comparable to timolol in lowering iop, but is less effective in some patients. beta-blockers can be used with other antiglaucoma medications, but their combined action with epinephrine (adrenaline) is suspect, particularly in the case of the nonselective beta-blockers, and the effect should be assessed in patients on an individual basis. local stinging can be a problem in some patients with betaxolol. the most serious side effects of beta-blockers are the exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease with nonselective agents and the precipitation of bronchospasm in some patients. betaxolol seems relatively free of adverse respiratory effects, although this may be dose-related and extreme caution should still be exercised in patients with any history of respiratory illness. because of the lower risk of precipitating side effects, betaxolol is probably the beta-blocker of first choice for use in glaucoma; timolol or levobunolol are reserved for patients who do not respond satisfactorily to betaxolol and are quite free of respiratory disease.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ molecular mechanisms of fibrosis-associated promotion of liver carcinogenesis. hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) mostly develops in patients with advanced fibrosis; however, the mechanisms of interaction between a genotoxic insult and fibrogenesis are not well understood. this study tested a hypothesis that fibrosis promotes hcc via a mechanism that involves activation of liver stem cells. first, b6c3f1 mice were administered diethylnitrosamine (den; single ip injection of 1mg/kg at 14 days of age). second, carbon tetrachloride (ccl(4); 0.2ml/kg, 2/week ip starting at 8 weeks of age) was administered for 9 or 14 weeks to develop advanced liver fibrosis. in animals treated with den as neonates, presence of liver fibrosis led to more than doubling (to 100%) of the liver tumor incidence as early as 5 months of age. this effect was associated with activation of cells with progenitor features in noncancerous liver tissue, including markers of replicative senescence (p16), oncofetal transformation (afp, h19, and bex1), and increased "stemness" (prom1 and epcam). in contrast, the dose of den used did not modify the extent of liver inflammation, fibrogenesis, oxidative stress, proliferation, or apoptosis induced by subchronic ccl(4) administration. this study demonstrates the potential role of liver stem-like cells in the mechanisms of chemical-induced, fibrosis-promoted hcc. we posit that the combination of genotoxic and fibrogenic insults is a sensible approach to model liver carcinogenesis in experimental animals. these results may contribute to identification of cirrhotic patients predisposed to hcc by analyzing the expression of hepatic progenitor cell markers in the noncancerous liver tissue.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ hydrogen sulfide as an allosteric modulator of atp-sensitive potassium channels in colonic inflammation. the atp-sensitive potassium channel (k(atp)) in mouse colonic smooth muscle cell is a complex containing a pore-forming subunit (kir6.1) and a sulfonylurea receptor subunit (sur2b). these channels contribute to the cellular excitability of smooth muscle cells and hence regulate the motility patterns in the colon. whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to study the alterations in k(atp) channels in smooth muscle cells in experimental colitis. colonic inflammation was induced in balb/c mice after intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. k(atp) currents were measured at a holding potential of -60 mv in high k(+) external solution. the concentration response to levcromakalim (levc), a k(atp) channel opener, was significantly shifted to the left in the inflamed smooth-muscle cells. both the potency and maximal currents induced by levc were enhanced in inflammation. the ec(50) values in control were 6259 nm (n = 10) and 422 nm (n = 8) in inflamed colon, and the maximal currents were 9.9 ± 0.71 pa/pf (60 μm) in control and 39.7 ± 8.8 pa/pf (3 μm) after inflammation. as was seen with levc, the potency and efficacy of sodium hydrogen sulfide (nahs) (10-1000 μm) on k(atp) currents were significantly greater in inflamed colon compared with controls. in control cells, pretreatment with 100 µm nahs shifted the ec(50) for lev-induced currents from 2838 (n = 6) to 154 (n = 8) nm. sulfhydration of sulfonylurea receptor 2b (sur2b) was induced by nahs and colonic inflammation. these data suggest that sulfhydration of sur2b induces allosteric modulation of k(atp) currents in colonic inflammation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ nonadrenergic imidazoline binding sites on human platelets. human platelets are shown to possess at least two high-affinity, imidazol(in)e-preferring binding sites that are pharmacologically distinct from alpha-2 adrenoceptors. these nonadrenergic sites were radiolabeled even in the presence of a 10 microm norepinephrine mask of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing [3h]idazoxan (idx) binding vs. [125i]p-iodoclonidine (pic) binding. nonadrenergic [125i]pic-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by [3h] idx were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic [125i]pic-labeled sites had bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the [3h]idx-labeled sites had bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes). furthermore, competition binding studies in the presence of a 10 microm norepinephrine mask revealed major (approximately 75%) and minor (approximately 25%) binding components on plasma membranes for [125i]pic. affinities for the major nonadrenergic [125i]pic binding site were highly comparable to human subtype-i1 imidazol(in)e receptor sites in the brain stem (rank order: moxonidine > clonidine > cirazoline > idx > amiloride). however, the minor component of [125i]pic binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except guanabenz. finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by [3h]idx, was consistent with a subtype-i2 imidazol(in)e receptor site (rank order: cirazoline > idx >> amiloride > moxonidine > clonidine). thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess imidazoline receptors (subtype-i1 imidazol(in)e receptor and subtype-i2 imidazol(in)e receptor), plus a novel guanabenz-sensitive site, as well as an alpha-2a adrenoceptor. these nonadrenoceptor binding sites may explain certain novel platelet aggregatory properties previously ascribed to clonidine and endogenous clonidine-displacing substance(s), and may serve as markers of imidazoline receptors in humans.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ deep brain stimulation, histone deacetylase inhibitors and glutamatergic drugs rescue resistance to fear extinction in a genetic mouse model. anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent, excessive fear. therapeutic interventions that reverse deficits in fear extinction represent a tractable approach to treating these disorders. we previously reported that 129s1/svimj (s1) mice show no extinction learning following normal fear conditioning. we now demonstrate that weak fear conditioning does permit fear reduction during massed extinction training in s1 mice, but reveals specific deficiency in extinction memory consolidation/retrieval. rescue of this impaired extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with d-cycloserine (n-methly-d-aspartate partial agonist) or ms-275 (histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor), applied after extinction training. we next examined the ability of different drugs and non-pharmacological manipulations to rescue the extreme fear extinction deficit in s1 following normal fear conditioning with the ultimate aim to produce low fear levels in extinction retrieval tests. results showed that deep brain stimulation (dbs) by applying high frequency stimulation to the nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) during extinction training, indeed significantly reduced fear during extinction retrieval compared to sham stimulation controls. rescue of both impaired extinction acquisition and deficient extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with prior extinction training administration of valproic acid (a gabaergic enhancer and hdac inhibitor) or amn082 [metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mglu7) agonist], while ms-275 or pepa (ampa receptor potentiator) failed to affect extinction acquisition in s1 mice. collectively, these data identify potential beneficial effects of dbs and various drug treatments, including those with hdac inhibiting or mglu7 agonism properties, as adjuncts to overcome treatment resistance in exposure-based therapies. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'cognitive enhancers'.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ sulindac independently modulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways. colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the united states. substantial human and animal data support the ability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to cause regression of existing colon tumors and prevent new tumor formation. the mechanism by which the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac prevents tumor growth is poorly understood and seems complex as sulindac can modulate several growth-related signaling pathways. sulindac metabolites simultaneously (a) increase cellular cyclic gmp and subsequently activate cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase (pkg); (b) activate c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk); (c) inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2); and (d) decrease beta-catenin protein expression at times and doses consistent with apoptosis. the purpose of this study was to determine if pkg, erk1/2, jnk, and beta-catenin are independent targets for sulindac in vitro. pharmacologic activation of pkg with yc-1 increases jnk phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells without modulating erk1/2 phosphorylation or beta-catenin protein expression. inhibition of erk1/2 with u0126 induces apoptosis but fails to activate jnk phosphorylation or down-regulate beta-catenin protein expression. cotreatment with u0126 and yc-1 synergistically increases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and recapitulates the effects of sulindac treatment on erk1/2, jnk, and beta-catenin. these results indicate that sulindac metabolites modulate erk1/2 and pkg pathways independently in colon cancer cells and suggest that the full apoptotic effect of sulindac is mediated by more than one pathway. using similar combinatorial approaches in vivo may provide more effective, less toxic chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies. such therapies could dramatically reduce the incidence and death rate from colorectal cancer.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ mechanism of specific membrane targeting by c2 domains: localized pools of target lipids enhance ca2+ affinity. the c2 domain is a ubiquitous, conserved protein signaling motif widely found in eukaryotic signaling proteins. although considerable functional diversity exists, most c2 domains are activated by ca2+ binding and then dock to a specific cellular membrane. the c2 domains of protein kinase calpha (pkcalpha) and cytosolic phospholipase a2alpha (cpla2alpha), for example, are known to dock to different membrane surfaces during an intracellular ca2+ signal. ca2+ activation targets the pkcalpha c2 domain to the plasma membrane and the cpla2alpha c2 domain to the internal membranes, with no detectable spatial overlap. it is crucial to determine how such targeting specificity is achieved at physiological bulk ca2+ concentrations that during a typical signaling event rarely exceed 1 mum. for the isolated pkcalpha c2 domain in the presence of physiological ca2+ levels, the target lipids phosphatidylserine (ps) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) are together sufficient to recruit the pkcalpha c2 domain to a lipid mixture mimicking the plasma membrane inner leaflet. for the cpla2alpha c2 domain, the target lipid phosphatidylcholine (pc) appears to be sufficient to drive membrane targeting to an internal membrane mimic at physiological ca2+ levels, although the results do not rule out a second, unknown target molecule. stopped-flow kinetic studies provide additional information about the fundamental molecular events that occur during ca2+-activated membrane docking. in principle, c2 domain-directed intracellular targeting, which requires coincidence detection of multiple signals (ca2+ and one or more target lipids), can exhibit two different mechanisms: messenger-activated target affinity (mata) and target-activated messenger affinity (tama). the c2 domains studied here both utilize the tama mechanism, in which the c2 domain ca2+ affinity is too low to be activated by physiological ca2+ signals in most regions of the cell. only when the c2 domain nears its target membrane, which provides a high local concentration of target lipid, is the effective ca2+ affinity increased by the coupled binding equilibrium to a level that enables substantial ca2+ activation and target docking. overall, the findings emphasize the importance of using physiological ligand concentrations in targeting studies because super-physiological concentrations can drive docking interactions even when an important targeting molecule is missing.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ tamoxifen represses mir-200 micrornas and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by up-regulating c-myc in endometrial carcinoma cell lines. although tamoxifen (tam), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been widely used in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer, its estrogen-like effect increases the risk of endometrial cancer. however, the molecular mechanisms of tam-induced endometrial carcinoma still remain unclear. in this report, we explored the role of micrornas (mirnas) in tam-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) in ecc-1 and ishikawa endometrial cancer cell lines and found mir-200 is involved in this process via the regulation of c-myc. when treated with tam, ecc-1 and ishikawa cells were characterized by higher invasiveness and motility and underwent emt. mir-200, a mirna family with tumor suppressive functions in a wide range of cancers, was found reduced in response to tam treatment. consistent with zinc finger e-box binding homeobox 2, which was confirmed as a direct target of mir-200b in endometrial cancer cell lines, some other key factors of emt such as snail and n-cadherin increased, whereas e-cadherin decreased in the tam-treated cells, contributing to tam-induced emt in these endometrial cancer cells. in addition, we showed that c-myc directly binds to and represses the promoter of mir-200 mirnas, and its up-regulation in tam-treated endometrial cancer cells leads to the down-regulation of mir-200 and eventually to emt. collectively, our data suggest that tam can repress the mir-200 family and induce emt via the up-regulation of c-myc in endometrial cancer cells. these findings describe a possible mechanism of tam-induced emt in endometrial cancer and provide a potential new therapeutic strategy for it.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cyclopenta[c]phenanthrenes - chemistry and biological activity. despite cyclopenta-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cp-pahs) having been detected in the environment, the ability of these compounds to induce cellular and tissue responses remains poorly characterized. in this review, we look at the chemistry and biological activity of the cyclopenta[c]phenanthrenes (cp[c]ph) as potential chemicals of concern in the process of risk assessment. the first part of the review deals with the environmental occurrence and chemistry of cp-pahs, focusing on available methods of cp[c]ph chemical synthesis. the most interesting structural feature of the cp[c]ph is the presence of a pseudo fjord-region constructed by the cyclopentane ring. this compound can be treated either as a structurally similar one to b[c]ph, or as a phenanthrene skeleton with an electrodonating alkyl substituent in the bay-region of the molecule. the second thread, providing available data on the adverse effects of cp[c]ph compounds on cells and tissues of living organisms, mainly fish, improves our understanding of these possible environmental hazards. the data show that cp[c]ph is less potent at inducing cyp1a gene expression in rainbow trout than benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p), a well-known ah-receptor agonist. interestingly, the cp[c]ph dependent up-regulation of cyp1a mrna is positively correlated with the incidences of clastogenic changes in rainbow trout erythrocytes. cp[c]ph has, comparably to b[a]p, a potential to repress expression of tumor suppressor p53, in the head kidney of rainbow trout. furthermore, estrogen responsive genes in fish liver, erα and vtg, are not induced by cp[c]ph, suggesting that the compound has no endocrine disrupting potential. however, some cp[c]phs show mutagenic activity when investigated in the ames test, and exhibit genotoxic properties in in vitro micronucleus assay. the above characteristics suggest that cp-pahs are chemicals of concern for which potential pathways of exposure should be further identified.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ uccb01-125, a dimeric inhibitor of psd-95, reduces inflammatory pain without disrupting cognitive or motor performance: comparison with the nmda receptor antagonist mk-801. excessive n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar)-dependent production of nitric oxide (no) is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic pain states, and is mediated by postsynaptic density protein-95 (psd-95). by binding to both the nmdar and neuronal no synthase (nnos), psd-95 mediates a specific coupling between nmdar activation and no production. nmdar antagonism shows anti-nociceptive action in humans and animal models of chronic pain but is associated with severe disturbances of cognitive and motor functions. an alternative approach to modulate the nmdar-related activity is to perturb the nmdar/psd-95/nnos complex by targeting psd-95, thereby decreasing no production without interfering with the nmdar ion channel function. here, we compared the effects of a dimeric psd-95 inhibitor, uccb01-125, and the nmdar antagonist, mk-801, on mechanical hypersensitivity in the complete freund's adjuvant (cfa) model of inflammatory pain. to examine side-effect profiles we also compared the effects of uccb01-125 and mk-801 in tests of attention, long-term memory, and motor performance. when administered concurrently with cfa, both mk-801 and uccb01-125 prevented the development of cfa-induced mechanical hypersensitivity 1 and 24 h after treatment. moreover, uccb01-125 was found to reverse cfa-induced hypersensitivity when administered 24 h after cfa treatment, an effect lasting for at least 3 days. at the dose reducing hypersensitivity, mk-801 disrupted attention, long-term memory, and motor performance. by contrast, even high doses of uccb01-125 were devoid of side-effects in these tests. the data suggest that psd-95 inhibition is a feasible strategy to prevent both development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory pain, while avoiding nmdar antagonism-related side-effects.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ amino acids as co-amorphous stabilizers for poorly water soluble drugs - part 1: preparation, stability and dissolution enhancement. poor aqueous solubility of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (api) is one of the most pressing problems in pharmaceutical research and development because up to 90% of new api candidates under development are poorly water soluble. these drugs usually have a low and variable oral bioavailability, and therefore an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. one of the most promising approaches to increase dissolution rate and solubility of these drugs is the conversion of a crystalline form of the drug into its respective amorphous form, usually by incorporation into hydrophilic polymers, forming glass solutions. however, this strategy only led to a small number of marketed products usually because of inadequate physical stability of the drug (crystallization). in this study, we investigated a fundamentally different approach to stabilize the amorphous form of drugs, namely the use of amino acids as small molecular weight excipients that form specific molecular interactions with the drug resulting in co-amorphous forms. the two poorly water soluble drugs carbamazepine and indomethacin were combined with amino acids from the binding sites of the biological receptors of these drugs. mixtures of drug and the amino acids arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine were prepared by vibrational ball milling. solid-state characterization with x-ray powder diffraction (xrpd) and differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) revealed that the various blends could be prepared as homogeneous, single phase co-amorphous formulations indicated by the appearance of an amorphous halo in the xrpd diffractograms and a single glass transition temperature (tg) in the dsc measurements. in addition, the tgs of the co-amorphous mixtures were significantly increased over those of the individual drugs. the drugs remained chemically stable during the milling process and the co-amorphous formulations were generally physically stable over at least 6months at 40°c under dry conditions. the dissolution rate of all co-amorphous drug-amino acid mixtures was significantly increased over that of the respective crystalline and amorphous pure drugs. amino acids thus appear as promising excipients to solve challenges connected with the stability and dissolution of amorphous drugs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ caffeine inhibits the checkpoint kinase atm. the basis of many anti-cancer therapies is the use of genotoxic agents that damage dna and thus kill dividing cells. agents that cause cells to override the dna-damage checkpoint are predicted to sensitize cells to killing by genotoxic agents. they have therefore been sought as adjuncts in radiation therapy and chemotherapy. one such compound, caffeine, uncouples cell-cycle progression from the replication and repair of dna [1] [2]. caffeine therefore servers as a model compound in establishing the principle that agents that override dna-damage checkpoints can be used to sensitize cells to the killing effects of genotoxic drugs [3]. but despite more than 20 years of use, the molecular mechanisms by which caffeine affects the cell cycle and checkpoint responses have not been identified. we investigated the effects of caffeine on the g2/m dna-damage checkpoint in human cells. we report that the radiation-induced activation of the kinase cds1 [4] (also known as chk2 [5]) is inhibited by caffeine in vivo and that atm kinase activity is directly inhibited by caffeine in vitro. inhibition of atm provides a molecular explanation of the attenuation of dna-damage checkpoint responses and for the increased radiosensitivity of caffeine-treated cells [6] [7] [8].$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ species-specific differences in the glucocorticoid receptor transactivation function upon binding with betamethasone-esters. glucocorticoids (gcs) are the most effective drugs for anti-inflammatory diseases. a number of adverse side effects, however, limit chronic treatment with gcs. to improve their therapeutic usefulness, attempts have been made to dissociate the two main actions of the glucocorticoid receptor (gr), transactivation and transrepression, which are believed to be responsible for the side effects and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. we report here species-specific differences in the transactivation response mediated by gr. dexamethasone (dex), betamethasone (bm), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression agonistic activity in a reporter assay using cv-1 cells transfected with either human or rat gr. these gcs also had full transactivation agonistic activity in cv-1 cells transfected with human gr. the esterified-bm, however, had only partial transactivation agonistic activity in cells transfected with rat gr, whereas bm and esterified-dex had full transactivation agonistic activity. moreover, in rat hepatoma h4-ii-e cells, the esterified-bm failed to induce tyrosine aminotransferase, which is regulated by gr-mediated transactivation activity. there were no significant differences between the binding affinity of these gcs to human and rat gr. consistent with the weak transactivation activity of esterified-bm mediated by rat gr, there were few side effects, evaluated by thymus involution and body weight loss, in an antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats. these results suggest that the potency of esterified-bm to induce transactivation activity is different between species and that this difference is not due to differences in receptor binding.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ vitamin c forestalls cigarette smoke induced nf-κb activation in alveolar epithelial cells. cigarette smoking causes cellular oxidative stress resulting in inflammatory diseases of lung wherein transcription factor nf-κb plays an important role. it is possible that vitamin c, an antioxidant, may prevent cigarette smoke (cs)-induced nf-κb activation that involves degradation of i-κbε and nuclear translocation of c-rel/p50 in alveolar epithelial cells. therefore, to examine the hypothesis, we verified the effect of vitamin c on cs-induced expression of nf-κb driven luciferase reporter and nf-κb binding at its target dna by emsa in alveolar epithelial a549 cells. we also examined the level of i-κbε and sub-cellular distribution of c-rel by western blotting and immunofluorescence respectively in cse-treated a549 cells with or without vitamin c pretreatment. we observed a significant reduction in cse induced luciferase expression, nf-κb dna binding, i-κbε degradation and c-rel nuclear translocation in cells pretreated with vitamin c. to further validate the result, we examined sub-cellular distribution of c-rel in lungs of cs-exposed guinea pigs treated or untreated with vitamin c. result showed that vitamin c treatment resulted in markedly reduced c-rel nuclear translocation. all these results demonstrate that vitamin c prevents cs(e)-induced nf-κb activation and thus it could be used for the prevention of cs-induced inflammatory diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ characterization of the mouse cold-menthol receptor trpm8 and vanilloid receptor type-1 vr1 using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (flipr) assay. 1. trpm8 (cmr1) is a ca(2+)-permeable channel, which can be activated by low temperatures, menthol, eucalyptol and icilin. it belongs to the transient receptor potential (trp) family, and therefore is related to vanilloid receptor type-1 (vr1, trpv1). we tested whether substances which are structurally related to menthol, or which produce a cooling sensation, could activate trpm8, and compared the responses of trpm8 and vr1 to these ligands. 2. the effects of 70 odorants and menthol-related substances on recombinant mouse trpm8 (mtrpm8), expressed in hek293 cells, were examined using a flipr assay. in all, 10 substances (linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, ws-3, ws-23, frescolatmga, frescolatml, pmd38, coolactp and cooling agent 10) were found to be agonists. 3. the ec(50) values of the agonists defined their relative potencies: icilin (0.2+/-0.1 microm)>frescolatml (3.3+/-1.5 microm) > ws-3 (3.7+/-1.7 microm) >(-)menthol (4.1+/-1.3 microm) >frescolatmag (4.8+/-1.1 microm) > cooling agent 10 (6+/-2.2 microm) >(+)menthol (14.4+/-1.3 microm) > pmd38 (31+/-1.1 microm) > ws-23 (44+/-7.3 microm) > coolact p (66+/-20 microm) > geraniol (5.9+/-1.6 mm) > linalool (6.7+/-2.0 mm) > eucalyptol (7.7+/-2.0 mm) > hydroxycitronellal (19.6+/-2.2 mm). 4. known vr1 antagonists (bctc, thio-bctc and capsazepine) were also able to block the response of trpm8 to menthol (ic(50): 0.8+/-1.0, 3.5+/-1.1 and 18+/-1.1 microm, respectively). 5. the ca(2+) response of hvr1-transfected hek293 cells to the endogenous vr1 agonist n-arachidonoyl-dopamine was potentiated by low ph. in contrast, menthol- and icilin-activated trpm8 currents were suppressed by low ph. 6. in conclusion, in the present study, we identified 10 new agonists and three antagonists of trpm8. we found that, in contrast to vr1, trpm8 is inhibited rather than potentiated by protons.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ankyrin repeat and suppressors of cytokine signaling box protein asb-9 targets creatine kinase b for degradation. the suppressors of cytokine signaling (socs) proteins inhibit cytokine action by direct interaction with janus kinases or activated cytokine receptors. in addition to the n-terminal and src homology 2 domains that mediate these interactions, socs proteins contain a c-terminal socs box. dna data base searches have identified a number of other protein families that possess a socs box, of which the ankyrin repeat and socs box-containing (asb) proteins constitute the largest. although it is known that the socs proteins are involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling, the biological and biochemical functions of the asbs are largely undefined. using a proteomics approach, we demonstrate that creatine kinase b (ckb) interacts with asb-9 in a specific, socs box-independent manner. this interaction increases the polyubiquitylation of ckb and decreases total ckb levels within the cell. the targeting of ckb for degradation by asb-9 was primarily socs box-dependent and suggests that asb-9 acts as a specific ubiquitin ligase regulating levels of this evolutionarily conserved enzyme.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ biophysical properties, pharmacology, and modulation of human, neuronal l-type (alpha(1d), ca(v)1.3) voltage-dependent calcium currents. voltage-dependent calcium channels (vdccs) are multimeric complexes composed of a pore-forming alpha(1) subunit together with several accessory subunits, including alpha(2)delta, beta, and, in some cases, gamma subunits. a family of vdccs known as the l-type channels are formed specifically from alpha(1s) (skeletal muscle), alpha(1c) (in heart and brain), alpha(1d) (mainly in brain, heart, and endocrine tissue), and alpha(1f) (retina). neuroendocrine l-type currents have a significant role in the control of neurosecretion and can be inhibited by gtp-binding (g-) proteins. however, the subunit composition of the vdccs underlying these g-protein-regulated neuroendocrine l-type currents is unknown. to investigate the biophysical and pharmacological properties and role of g-protein modulation of alpha(1d) calcium channels, we have examined calcium channel currents formed by the human neuronal l-type alpha(1d) subunit, co-expressed with alpha(2)delta-1 and beta(3a), stably expressed in a human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cell line, using whole cell and perforated patch-clamp techniques. the alpha(1d)-expressing cell line exhibited l-type currents with typical characteristics. the currents were high-voltage activated (peak at +20 mv in 20 mm ba2+) and showed little inactivation in external ba2+, while displaying rapid inactivation kinetics in external ca2+. the l-type currents were inhibited by the 1,4 dihydropyridine (dhp) antagonists nifedipine and nicardipine and were enhanced by the dhp agonist bayk s-(-)8644. however, alpha(1d) l-type currents were not modulated by activation of a number of g-protein pathways. activation of endogenous somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) by somatostatin-14 or activation of transiently transfected rat d2 dopamine receptors (rd2(long)) by quinpirole had no effect. direct activation of g-proteins by the nonhydrolyzable gtp analogue, guanosine 5'-0-(3-thiotriphospate) also had no effect on the alpha(1d) currents. in contrast, in the same system, n-type currents, formed from transiently transfected alpha(1b)/alpha(2)delta-1/beta(3), showed strong g-protein-mediated inhibition. furthermore, the i-ii loop from the alpha(1d) clone, expressed as a glutathione-s-transferase (gst) fusion protein, did not bind gbetagamma, unlike the alpha(1b) i-ii loop fusion protein. these data show that the biophysical and pharmacological properties of recombinant human alpha(1d) l-type currents are similar to alpha(1c) currents, and these currents are also resistant to modulation by g(i/o)-linked g-protein-coupled receptors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ g protein-coupled receptors as direct targets of inhaled anesthetics. the molecular pharmacology of inhalational anesthetics remains poorly understood. despite accumulating evidence suggesting that neuronal membrane proteins are potential targets of inhaled anesthetics, most currently favored membrane protein targets lack any direct evidence for anesthetic binding. we report herein the location of the binding site for the inhaled anesthetic halothane at the amino acid residue level of resolution in the ligand binding cavity in a prototypical g protein-coupled receptor, bovine rhodopsin. tryptophan fluorescence quenching and direct photoaffinity labeling with [(14)c]halothane suggested an interhelical location of halothane with a stoichiometry of 1 (halothane/rhodopsin molar ratio). radiosequence analysis of [(14)c]halothane-labeled rhodopsin revealed that halothane contacts an amino acid residue (trp265) lining the ligand binding cavity in the transmembrane core of the receptor. the predicted functional consequence, competition between halothane and the ligand retinal, was shown here by spectroscopy and is known to exist in vivo. these data suggest that competition with endogenous ligands may be a general mechanism of the action of halothane at this large family of signaling proteins.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ polymorphisms in octn1 and octn2 transporters genes are associated with prolonged time to progression in unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours treated with imatinib therapy. the two basic mainstays of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (gist) treatment are surgery and imatinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that allows achieving a stable or responding disease in about 80% of patients with unresectable/metastatic gist. response to imatinib mainly depends from kit and pdgfrα mutational status. nevertheless, some patients with a potentially responsive genotype do not respond, and others develop a pattern of resistance to imatinib which is not associated with secondary mutations. this emphasizes the presence of mechanisms of resistance other than the receptor-related genotype, and the need of biological predictors to select the optimal therapeutic strategy, particularly now that other potent inhibitors are available. we investigated a panel of 31 polymorphisms in 11 genes, potentially associated with the pharmacogenetics of imatinib, in a group of 54 unresectable/metastatic gists treated with imatinib 400mg daily as first line therapy. included in this analysis were polymorphisms in the transporters' family slc22, slco, abc, and in the metabolizing genes cyp-3a4 and -3a5. time to progression was significantly improved in presence of the c allele in slc22a4 (octn1 rs1050152), and the two minor alleles (g) in slc22a5 (octn2 rs2631367 and rs2631372). importantly, multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, kit/pdgfrα mutational status, and tumour size, revealed that all the three genotypes maintained independent predictive significance. in conclusion, in this study we showed that slc22a4 and slc22a5 genotypes may be an important predictor of time to progression in gist patients receiving imatinib therapy. further investigations are required in an attempt to further personalize gist therapy.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ reduced in vitro and in vivo toxicity of sirna-lipoplexes with addition of polyglutamate. we previously designed a new sirna vector that efficiently silences genes in vitro and in vivo. the vector originality is based on the fact that, in addition to the sirna molecule, it contains two components: 1) a cationic liposome that auto-associates with the sirna to form particles called "lipoplexes" and, 2) an anionic polymer which enhances the lipoplex's efficiency. this anionic polymer can be a nucleic acid, a polypeptide or a polysaccharide. we show here how the nature of the added anionic polymer into our sirna delivery system impacts the toxic effects induced by sirna lipoplexes. we first observed that: (i) sirna lipoplexes-induced toxicity was cell line dependent, tumoral cell lines being the more sensitive; and (ii) plasmid dna-containing sirna lipoplexes were more toxic than polyglutamate-containing ones or cationic liposomes. we next determined that the toxicity induced by plasmid-containing lipoplexes is a long-lasting effect that decreased cell survival capacity for several generations. we also found that treated cells underwent death following apoptosis pathway. systemic injection to mice of sirna lipoplexes, rather than of cationic liposome, triggered a production of several cytokines in mice and replacement of plasmid by polyglutamate reduced the elevation of all assayed cytokines. in order to enhance sirna lipoplexes efficiency, the addition of polyglutamate as anionic polymer should be preferred to plasmid dna as far as in vitro as well as in vivo toxicity is concerned.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ transport function and transcriptional regulation of a liver-enriched human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2b1 transcriptional start site variant. human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2b1 (oatp2b1) is a membrane transporter that facilitates the cellular uptake of a number of endogenous compounds and drugs. oatp2b1 is widely expressed in tissues including the small intestine, liver, kidney, placenta, heart, skeletal muscle and platelets. recently, it has been shown that differential promoter usage in tissues results in expression of five oatp2b1 transcriptional start site variants which utilize distinct first exons but share common subsequent exons. these variants are expected to encode either a full length (oatp2b1-fl) or shortened protein lacking 22 n-terminus amino acids (oatp2b-short). little is known regarding the transport activity and regulation of oatp2b1 variants with n-terminus truncation. here, using absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction we find the full length variant is the major form expressed in duodenum but the short variant predominates in liver. using a transient heterologous cell expression system, we find that the transport activities of the short oatp2b1 variant towards substrates estrone sulfate and rosuvastatin are similar to the well-characterized full length variant. transcriptional activity screening of the liver enriched oatp2b1 variant promoter identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (hnf4α) as a novel transacting factor. with a combination of in silico screening, promoter mutation in cell-based reporter assays, sirna knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we identified a functional hnf4α binding site close to the transcription start site (-17 to -4 bp). we conclude that the major oatp2b1 protein form in liver is transport competent and its hepatic expression is regulated by hnf4α.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ glur5 kainate receptors, seizures, and the amygdala. the amygdala is a critical brain region for limbic seizure activity, but the mechanisms underlying its epileptic susceptibility are obscure. several lines of evidence implicate glur5 (glu(k5)) kainate receptors, a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor, in the amygdala's vulnerability to seizures and epileptogenesis. glur5 mrna is abundant in temporal lobe structures including the amygdala. brain slice recordings indicate that glur5 kainate receptors mediate a portion of the synaptic excitation of neurons in the rat basolateral amygdala. whole-cell voltage-clamp studies demonstrate that glur5 kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents are inwardly rectifying and are likely to be calcium permeable. prolonged activation of basolateral amygdala glur5 kainate receptors results in enduring synaptic facilitation through a calcium-dependent process. the selective glur5 kainate receptor agonist atpa induces spontaneous epileptiform bursting that is sensitive to the glur5 kainate receptor antagonist ly293558. intra-amygdala infusion of atpa in the rat induces limbic status epilepticus; in some animals, recurrent spontaneous seizures occur for months after the atpa treatment. together, these observations indicate that glur5 kainate receptors have a unique role in triggering epileptiform activity in the amygdala and could participate in long-term plasticity mechanisms that underlie some forms of epileptogenesis. accordingly, glur5 kainate receptors represent a potential target for antiepileptic and antiepileptogenic drug treatments. most antiepileptic drugs do not act through effects on glutamate receptors. however, topiramate at low concentrations causes slow inhibition of glur5 kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents in the basolateral amygdala, indicating that it may protect against seizures, at least in part, through suppression of glur5 kainate receptor responses.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ the human ribonucleotide reductase subunit hrrm2 complements p53r2 in response to uv-induced dna repair in cells with mutant p53. ribonucleotide reductase (rr) is responsible for the de novo conversion of the ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, which are essential for dna synthesis and repair. rr consists of two subunits, hrrm1 and hrrm2. p53r2 is a new rr family member. because the majority of human tumors possess mutant p53, it is important to know the molecular mechanism by which mutant p53 regulates rr and to what extent. in this study, we investigated the expression and function of p53r2 and hrrm2 after uv treatment in human prostate cancer pc3 cells, which possess mutant p53 with a truncated cooh-terminal, and in human oropharyngeal cancer kb cells, which possess wild-type p53. p53r2 (analyzed by western blot and standardized relative to coomassie blue-stained band) was down-regulated in pc3 cells and up-regulated in kb cells after uv exposure. in contrast, hrrm2 was up-regulated by uv in both pc3 cells and kb cells. hrrm2 and p53r2 mrna levels were assessed by northern blot, and the results paralleled that of the western blot. coimmunoprecipitation assays using agarose-conjugated goat antihuman rrm1 antibody confirmed that the p53r2 binding to hrrm1 decreased in pc3 cells but increased in kb cells after uv treatment. hrrm2 binding to hrrm1 increased in both cell lines under the same conditions. these results suggest that pc3 cells are deficient in both transcription of p53r2 and binding to hrrm1 in response to uv irradiation. confocal microscopy further confirmed that these findings were not due to translocation of hrrm2 and p53r2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. rr activity was measured following uv treatment and shown to increase in pc3 cells. it was unchanged in proportional of kb cells. the rr activity is consistent with the expression of hrrm2 seen in the western blots. thus, we hypothesize that hrrm2 complements p53r2 to form rr holoenzyme and maintain rr activity in pc3 cells after uv treatment. to further confirm this hypothesis, we examined the effect of rrm2 inhibitors on cells exposed to uv. in pc3 cells, hydroxyurea inhibited hrrm2 and resulted in increased sensitivity to uv irradiation. we also examined the effect of uv treatment on the colony-forming ability of cells transfected with hrrm2 as well as p53r2 sense or antisense expression vectors. expression of antisense hrrm2 in pc3 cells led to decreased hrrm2 expression and resulted in greater sensitivity to uv than observed in wild-type pc3 cells. taken together, we conclude that uv-induced activation of p53r2 transcription and binding of p53r2 to hrrm1 to form rr holoenzyme are impaired in the p53-mutant cell line pc3.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ arsenic inhibits autophagic flux activating the nrf2-keap1 pathway in a p62-dependent manner. the nrf2-keap1 signaling pathway is a protective mechanism promoting cell survival. activation of the nrf2 pathway by natural compounds has been proven to be an effective strategy for chemoprevention. interestingly, a cancer-promoting function of nrf2 has been recently observed in many types of tumors due to deregulation of the nrf2-keap1 axis, which leads to constitutive activation of nrf2. here, we report a novel mechanism of nrf2 activation by arsenic that is distinct from that of chemopreventive compounds. arsenic deregulates the autophagic pathway through blockage of autophagic flux, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and sequestration of p62, keap1, and lc3. thus, arsenic activates nrf2 through a non-canonical mechanism (p62-dependent), leading to a chronic, sustained activation of nrf2. in contrast, activation of nrf2 by sulforaphane and tert-butylhydroquinone depend upon keap1-c151 and not p62 (the canonical mechanism). more importantly, sf and tbhq do not have any effect on autophagy. in fact, sf and tbhq alleviate arsenic-mediated deregulation of autophagy. collectively, these findings provide evidence that arsenic causes prolonged activation of nrf2 through autophagy dysfunction, possibly providing a similar scenario to constitutive activation of nrf2 found in certain human cancers. this may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity in humans.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

[125i]-mip-1beta bound with similar high affinity to ccr5 from macaque (k(d) = 0.24 +/- 0.05 nm) and human (k(d) = 0.23 +/- 0.05 nm) and with similar kinetic properties. in competition binding studies the affinity of a range of human chemokines for macaque ccr5 was also similar to human ccr5. maraviroc inhibited binding of [125i]-mip-1beta to ccr5 from macaque and human with similar potency (ic50 = 17.50 +/- 1.24 nm and 7.18 +/- 0.93 nm, respectively) and antagonised mip-1beta induced intracellular calcium release mediated through ccr5 from macaque and human with similar potency (ic50 = 17.50 +/- 3.30 nm and 12.07 +/- 1.89, respectively). [3h]-maraviroc bound with high affinity to ccr5 from macaque (k(d) = 1.36+/-0.07 nm) and human (k(d) = 0.86 +/- 0.08 nm), but was found to dissociate approximately 10-fold more quickly from macaque ccr5. however, as with the human receptor, maraviroc was shown to be a high affinity, potent functional antagonist of macaque ccr5 thereby indicating that the macaque should be a suitable species in which to evaluate the pharmacology, safety and potential mechanism-related toxicology of novel ccr5 antagonists.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ mechanisms of agonist-induced down-regulation of the human kappa-opioid receptor: internalization is required for down-regulation. previously, we showed that the human kappa-opioid receptor (hkor) stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells underwent down-regulation after prolonged u50,488h treatment. in the present study, we determined the mechanisms underlying this process. u50, 488h caused a significant down-regulation of the hkor, although etorphine did not. neither u50,488h nor etorphine caused down-regulation of the rat kappa-opioid receptor. thus, similar to internalization, there are agonist and species differences in down-regulation of kappa-opioid receptors. expression of the dominant negative mutants arrestin-2(319-418) or dynamin i-k44a significantly reduced u50,488h-induced down-regulation of the hkor. coexpression of grk2 or grk2 and arrestin-2 permitted etorphine to induce down-regulation of the hkor, although expression of arrestin-2 or dynamin i alone did not. expression of the dominant negative mutants rab5a-n133i or rab7-n125i blunted u50,488h-induced down-regulation. pretreatment with lysosomal enzyme inhibitors [(2s, 3s)trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester or chloroquine] or proteasome inhibitors (proteasome inhibitor i, mg-132, or lactacystin) decreased the extent of u50,488h-induced down-regulation. a combination of chloroquine and proteasome inhibitor i abolished u50,488h-induced down-regulation. these results indicate that u50,488h-induced down-regulation of the hkor involves grk-, arrestin-2-, dynamin-, rab5-, and rab7-dependent mechanisms and receptors seem to be trafficked to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation. thus, u50,488h-induced internalization and down-regulation of the hkor share initial common mechanisms. to the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first report on the involvement of both rab5 and rab7 in agonist-induced down-regulation of a g protein-coupled receptor. in addition, this study is among the first to show the involvement of proteasomes in agonist-induced down-regulation of a g protein-coupled receptor.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ a structural and functional perspective into the mechanism of ca2+-sensitizers that target the cardiac troponin complex. the ca(2+) dependent interaction between troponin i (ctni) and troponin c (ctnc) triggers contraction in heart muscle. heart failure is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output, and compounds that increase the sensitivity of cardiac muscle to ca(2+) have therapeutic potential. the ca(2+)-sensitizer, levosimendan, targets ctnc; however, detailed understanding of its mechanism has been obscured by its instability. in order to understand how this class of positive inotropes function, we investigated the mode of action of two fluorine containing novel analogs of levosimendan; 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yloxy acetic acid (dfbp-o) and 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl acetic acid (dfbp). the affinities of dfbp and dfbp-o for the regulatory domain of ctnc were measured in the absence and presence of ctni by nmr spectroscopy, and dfbp-o was found to bind more strongly than dfbp. dfbp-o also increased the affinity of ctni for ctnc. dfbp-o increased the ca(2+)-sensitivity of demembranated cardiac trabeculae in a manner similar to levosimendan. the high resolution nmr solution structure of the ctnc-ctni-dfbp-o ternary complex showed that dfbp-o bound at the hydrophobic interface formed by ctnc and ctni making critical interactions with residues such as arg147 of ctni. in the absence of ctni, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of ctnc. the structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of ca(2+)-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of ctnc and stabilizing the pivotal ctnc-ctni regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as w7 at the same interface.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ nitrosoureas inhibit the stathmin-mediated migration and invasion of malignant glioma cells. malignant gliomas are the most common primary intrinsic brain tumors and are highly lethal. the widespread migration and invasion of neoplastic cells from the initial site of tumor formation into the surrounding brain render these lesions refractory to definitive surgical treatment. stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein that mediates cell cycle progression, can also regulate directed cell movement. nitrosoureas, traditionally viewed as dna alkylating agents, can also covalently modify proteins such as stathmin. we therefore sought to establish a role for stathmin in malignant glioma cell motility, migration, and invasion and determine the effects of nitrosoureas on these cell movement-related processes. scratch wound-healing recovery, boyden chamber migration, matrigel invasion, and organotypic slice invasion assays were performed before and after the down-regulation of cellular stathmin levels and in the absence and presence of sublethal nitrosourea ([1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea]; ccnu) concentrations. we show that decreases in stathmin expression lead to significant decreases in malignant glioma cell motility, migration, and invasion. ccnu, at a concentration of 10 micromol/l, causes similar significant decreases, even in the absence of any effects on cell viability. the direct inhibition of stathmin by ccnu is likely a contributing factor. these findings suggest that the inhibition of stathmin expression and function may be useful in limiting the spread of malignant gliomas within the brain, and that nitrosoureas may have therapeutic benefits in addition to their antiproliferative effects.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ heterogeneity of persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. a series of 175 cases. unlabelled: hyperinsulinism is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by severe hypoglycaemia due to an inappropriate oversecretion of insulin. in a personal series of 175 patients investigated for hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia over the last 20 years, we review clinical presentations, molecular studies and therapeutic management of hyperinsulinism. there were 98 neonatal-onset patients, including 86 permanent hyperinsulinism and 12 transient forms, 68 with infancy-onset and nine with childhood-onset. hyperammonaemia was found in 12 out of 69 patients tested, 4 neonates and 8 infants. neonates were clinically more severely affected than infants. diagnosis of infancy-onset hyperinsulinism was often delayed because of less profound hypoglycaemia and better tolerance to hypoglycaemia. neonates required higher rates of i.v. glucose than infants to maintain normal plasma glucose levels (16 mg/kg per min versus 12 mg/kg per min). only 16% of neonates were diazoxide-sensitive compared to 66% of the infants. neonates with hyperammonaemia or transient hyperinsulinism were diazoxide-sensitive. most neonates were pancreatectomised whereas 65% of the infants were treated medically. among surgically-treated patients, 47% had a focal adenomatous hyperplasia (31 neonates and 13 infants) and 53% a diffuse form of hyperinsulinism (39 neonates and 11 infants). diazoxide-responsiveness in the focal and diffuse forms did not differ in both neonates and infants; it depended only upon the age of onset of hypoglycaemia. one or two mutations, sur1 or kir6.2, were found in 41 of 73 neonates who were investigated and in 13/38 infants using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of both genes. almost all patients with sur1 (38/41) or kir6.2 (5/7) mutations were resistant to diazoxide. ten patients with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonaemia syndrome had a mutation in the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (three neonates and seven infants) after reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of cdna. no mutation was found by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism in the glucokinase gene. eight of nine patients with childhood onset hyperinsulinism were treated surgically and histological examination confirmed an adenoma in each case. conclusion: the clinical severity of hyperinsulinism varies mainly with age at onset of hypoglycaemia. the heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism has major consequences in terms of therapeutic outcome and genetic counselling.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ comparative proteomics of ovarian epithelial tumors. we analyzed 12 ovarian epithelial tumors using 2d page-based comparative proteomics to construct intra- and inter-tumoral distance map trees and to discover surrogate biomarkers indicative of an ovarian tumor. the analysis was performed after laser microdissection of 12 fresh-frozen tissue samples, including 4 serous, 5 mucinous, and 3 endometrioid tumors, with correlation with their histopathological characteristics. ovarian epithelial tumors and normal tissues showed an apparent separation on the distance map tree. mucinous carcinomas were closest to the normal group, whereas serous carcinomas were located furthest from the normal group. all mucinous tumors with aggressive histology were separated from the low malignant potential (lmp) group. the benign-looking cysts adjacent to the intraepithelial carcinoma (iec) showed an expression pattern identical to that of the iec area. the extent of change on the lineages leading to the mucinous and serous carcinoma was 1.98-fold different. the overall gene expression profiles of serous or endometrioid carcinomas appeared to be less affected by grade or stage than by histologic type. the potential candidate biomarkers screened in ovarian tumors and found to be significantly up-regulated in comparison to normal tissues were as follows: nm23, annexin-1, protein phosphatase-1, ferritin light chain, proteasome alpha-6, and nagk (n-acetyl glucosamine kinase). in conclusion, ovarian mucinous tumors are distinct from other ovarian epithelial tumors. lmp mucinous tumors showing histologically aggressive features belong to mucinous carcinoma on the proteomic basis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ synergy between pairs of competitive antagonists at adult human muscle acetylcholine receptors. background: synergistic neuromuscular blocking effects have been observed clinically with certain pairs of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) competitive antagonists. the mechanism for synergy has not been elucidated. we tested the hypothesis that synergy arises from a differential selectivity of antagonists for the two ligand binding sites on adult human nachr. methods: we expressed nachr in bosc23 cells. we applied ach with or without antagonists to outside-out patches and measured macroscopic currents at room temperature. we determined the ic(90) for (+)-tubocurarine, metocurine, pancuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, rocuronium, and atracurium. for 15 combinations of two antagonists, we determined the ic(90) for one antagonist in the presence of the ic(70) of a second antagonist. we constructed isobolograms for 90% inhibition. for single antagonists, we measured inhibition of receptors containing mutations in the epsilon- and delta-subunits to determine site selectivity. results: two pairs of antagonists, metocurine+cisatracurium and cisatracurium+ atracurium exhibited additive inhibition. ten combinations, including (+)-tubocurarine+ pancuronium and pancuronium+vecuronium, were highly synergistic such that the combination was two to three times more effective than expected for additivity. three combinations were 1.5-1.6 times more effective than expected for additivity. inhibition by (+)-tubocurarine and metocurine was sensitive to mutations in the epsilon-subunit only. vecuronium was affected by the delta-subunit mutation only. inhibition by other antagonists was decreased by mutations in either subunit. conclusions: many combinations of antagonists exhibited synergistic effects on adult human nachr. synergy was observed with structurally similar and dissimilar antagonists. the degree of synergy did not always correlate well with site specificity assayed with mutants. in some, but not all cases, the synergy at the receptor level correlated with clinical determinations of synergy. we conclude that the synergistic actions of muscle relaxants can be partially explained by direct interactions with adult human nachr.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ characterisation of acetylcholinesterase release from neuronal cells. although acetylcholinesterase (ache) is primarily a hydrolytic enzyme, metabolising the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, it also has some non-catalytic functions in the brain which are far less well characterised. ache was shown to be secreted or shed from the neuronal cell surface like several other membrane proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein (app). since ache does not possess a transmembrane domain, its anchorage in the membrane is established via the proline rich membrane anchor (prima), a transmembrane protein. both the subunit oligomerisation and membrane anchor of ache are shared by a related enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (bche), the physiological function of which in the brain is unclear. in this work, we have assayed the relative activities of ache and bche in membrane fractions and culture medium of three different neuronal cell lines, namely the neuroblastoma cell lines sh-sy5y and nb7 and the mouse basal forebrain cell line sn56. in an effort to understand the shedding process of ache, we have used several pharmacological treatments, which showed that it is likely to be mediated in part by an edta- and batimastat-sensitive, but gm6001-insensitive metalloprotease, with the possible additional involvement of a thiol isomerase. cellular release of ache by sh-sy5y is significantly enhanced by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (machr) agonists carbachol or muscarine, with the effect of carbachol blocked by the machr antagonist atropine. ache has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease and it has been shown that it accelerates formation and increases toxicity of amyloid fibrils, which have been closely linked to the pathology of ad. in light of this, greater understanding of ache and bche physiology may also benefit ad research.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ characterisation of the 5-ht receptor binding profile of eletriptan and kinetics of [3h]eletriptan binding at human 5-ht1b and 5-ht1d receptors. the affinity of eletriptan ((r)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-5-[2-(phenylsulphonyl )ethyl]-1h-indole) for a range of 5-ht receptors was compared to values obtained for other 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists known to be effective in the treatment of migraine. eletriptan, like sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan and rizatriptan had highest affinity for the human 5-ht1b, 5-ht1d and putative 5-ht1f receptor. kinetic studies comparing the binding of [3h]eletriptan and [3h]sumatriptan to the human recombinant 5-ht1b and 5-ht1d receptors expressed in hela cells revealed that both radioligands bound with high specificity (>90%) and reached equilibrium within 10-15 min. however, [3h]eletriptan had over 6-fold higher affinity than [3h]sumatriptan at the 5-ht1d receptor (k(d)): 0.92 and 6.58 nm, respectively) and over 3-fold higher affinity than [3h]sumatriptan at the 5-ht1b receptor (k(d): 3.14 and 11.07 nm, respectively). association and dissociation rates for both radioligands could only be accurately determined at the 5-ht1d receptor and then only at 4 degrees c. at this temperature, [3h]eletriptan had a significantly (p<0.05) faster association rate (k(on) 0.249 min(-1) nm(-1)) than [3h]sumatriptan (k(on) 0.024 min(-1) nm(-1)) and a significantly (p<0.05) slower off-rate (k(off) 0.027 min(-1) compared to 0.037 min(-1) for [3h]sumatriptan). these data indicate that eletriptan is a potent ligand at the human 5-ht1b, 5-ht1d, and 5-ht1f receptors and are consistent with its potent vasoconstrictor activity and use as a drug for the acute treatment of migraine headache.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ comparison of ophthalmic beta-blocking agents. glaucoma is described, and the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of betaxolol and levobunolol in comparison with timolol are reviewed. betaxolol and levobunolol are two beta-adrenergic blocking agents being marketed as ophthalmic solutions for treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (poag) and ocular hypertension (oht). betaxolol is a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, while levobunolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. double-blind comparative trials have suggested that betaxolol has an equal to slightly lower efficacy and levobunolol has equal efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure (iop) compared with timolol, the first ophthalmic beta blocker. a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 15-35% occurs with both betaxolol and levobunolol and is reported to be maintained with prolonged use. betaxolol is associated with a higher (25%) incidence of local ocular adverse reactions than timolol. however, betaxolol produces less systemic beta 2- and possibly beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade than either timolol or levobunolol. betaxolol may be relatively safer to use in patients with reactive airway disease than either timolol or levobunolol. levobunolol causes a similar to greater incidence of local ocular adverse reactions and similar systemic beta blockade compared with timolol. levobunolol may possibly be longer acting than timolol, allowing more patients to be controlled by once-daily dosing. betaxolol and levobunolol appear to be similar to timolol in controlling iop in patients with poag and oht; additional experience with these agents is needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each agent.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ can the chemical reactivity of an ultimate carcinogen be related to its carcinogenicity? an application to propylene oxide. in this article we report calculations of the activation free energy for a chemical reaction between propylene oxide and dna, in particular with the guanine at the n7 position. calculations were performed using hartree-fock and mp2 methods in conjunction with flexible basis sets. the effects of solvation were considered using the langevin dipoles and solvent reaction field methods. the calculated activation free energies are in good agreement with the experimental value of 25.36 kcal/mol. moreover, the reactivities of a series of ultimate carcinogens of the epoxy type toward dna are shown to be related to their carcinogenicities. higher reactivity is generally associated with higher carcinogenicity, although transport properties, reactions with ultimate carcinogen scavengers, and the dna correction mechanism are also very important. it is very likely that the window of reactivity rather than a high reactivity value is the relevant measure of carcinogenicity, since highly reactive ultimate carcinogens interact with water and proteins before they reach dna.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ threshold concentrations of endothelin-1: the effects on contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine in isolated rat cerebral and mesenteric arteries. this study compares the effects of threshold concentrations of endothelin-1 in isolated rat basilar arteries with those in mesenteric arterial branches and investigates the mechanisms of inhibitory and potentiating endothelin-1-effects. in basilar arteries, endothelin-1 reduces the contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), by the thromboxane a2 agonist u46619, and by vasopressin. the inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on the contraction induced by 5-ht is abolished by deendothelialization, by the endothelin et(b) receptor antagonist res 701-1, by indomethacin, or by glibenclamide. in mesenteric arteries, endothelin-1 potentiates the contractile effects of 5-ht, u46619, and vasopressin. the potentiation of the contractile effect induced by 5-ht is only somewhat modified by deendothelialization, but abolished by the thromboxane a2 receptor antagonists gr32191 and ridogrel. u46619 potentiates the 5-ht-effect in mesenteric arteries. thus, though the contractile endothelin et(a) receptors were not blocked, threshold concentrations of endothelin-1 inhibited contractile effects in the rat basilar artery via activation of endothelial et(b) receptors. prostaglandins and atp-sensitive k+ channels are involved in this inhibitory action. in contrast, endothelin-1 potentiates contractile actions in mesenteric arteries via the release of endogeneous thromboxane a2 from non-endothelial cells. the study points out the completely different role of the endothelium in combined effects of endothelin-1 between cerebral and mesenteric arteries.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ tyrosinase catalyzes an unusual oxidative decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxymandelate. tyrosinase usually catalyzes the conversion of monophenols to o-diphenols and oxidation of diphenols to the corresponding quinones. however, when 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid was provided as the substrate, it catalyzed an unusual oxidative decarboxylation reaction generating 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde as the sole product. the identity of the product was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) as well as ultraviolet and infrared spectral studies. none of the following enzymes tested catalyzed the new reaction: galactose oxidase, ceruloplasmin, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate oxidase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and peroxidase. phenol oxidase inhibitors such as phenylthiourea, potassium cyanide, and sodium azide inhibited the reaction drastically, suggesting the participation of the active site copper of the enzyme in the catalysis. mimosine, a well-known competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, competitively inhibited the new reaction also. 4-hydroxymandelic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelic acid neither served as substrates nor inhibited the reaction. putative intermediates such as 3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol and (3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)formic acid did not accumulate during the reaction. oxidation to a quinone methide derivative rather than conventional quinone accounts for this unusual oxidative decarboxylation reaction. earlier from this laboratory, we reported the conversion of 4-alkylcatechols to quinone methides catalyzed by a cuticular phenol oxidase [sugumaran, m., & lipke, h. (1983) febs lett. 155, 65-68]. present studies demonstrate that mushroom tyrosinase will also catalyze quinone methide production with the same active site copper if a suitable substrate such as 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid is provided.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(2) exposure histories vary in secondary 11q23 leukemia, as the only topoisomerase ii inhibitor was dactinomycin in one case, and, in another case, no topoisomerase ii inhibitor was administered.

consider the abstract: $ effect of antidepressant drugs in mice lacking the norepinephrine transporter. one of the main theories concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs (ads) is based on the notion that the neurochemical background of depression involves an impairment of central noradrenergic transmission with a concomitant decrease of the norepinephrine (ne) in the synaptic gap. many ads increase synaptic ne availability by inhibition of the reuptake of ne. using mice lacking ne transporter (net-/-) we examined their baseline phenotype as well as the response in the forced swim test (fst) and in the tail suspension test (tst) upon treatment with ads that display different pharmacological profiles. in both tests, the net-/- mice behaved like wild-type (wt) mice acutely treated with ads. autoradiographic studies showed decreased binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand [3h]cgp12177 in the cerebral cortex of net-/- mice, indicating the changes at the level of beta-adrenergic receptors similar to those obtained with ads treatment. the binding of [3h]prazosin to alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of net-/- mice was also decreased, most probably as an adaptive response to the sustained elevation of extracellular ne levels observed in these mice. a pronounced net knockout-induced shortening of the immobility time in the tst (by ca 50%) compared to wt mice was not reduced any further by net-inhibiting ads such as reboxetine, desipramine, and imipramine. citalopram, which is devoid of affinity for the net, exerted a significant reduction of immobility time in the net-/- mice. in the fst, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and citalopram administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by net knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered desipramine was observed in net-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test. from the present study, it may be concluded that mice lacking the net may represent a good model of some aspects of depression-resistant behavior, paralleled with alterations in the expression of adrenergic receptors, which result as an adaptation to elevated levels of extracellular ne.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ complexities of androgen action. androgens mediate a wide range of processes during embryogenesis and in the adult. in mammals, the principal androgens are testosterone and its 5alpha-reduced metabolite, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (dht). although these androgenic hormones are diverse in character, it is believed that their effects are mediated via the protein products of a single androgen receptor gene encoded on the x-chromosome. a great deal of information has now accumulated pertaining to the mechanisms by which nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor, modulate the activity of responsive genes. the studies have demonstrated the participation of a number of ancillary proteins in modulating activation or repression by nuclear receptors. in addition to studies focused on the mechanisms of nuclear receptor function, additional work has illuminated the mechanism by which androgens are metabolized in selected tissues. this information provides a perspective on the number of levels of complexity by which differential gene regulation by androgens may occur in different tissues and in different cell types.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ metabolic syndrome: adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and malonyl coenzyme a. the metabolic syndrome can be defined as a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance, central obesity, and a predisposition to type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, premature atherosclerosis, and other diseases. an increasing body of evidence has linked the metabolic syndrome to abnormalities in lipid metabolism that ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction. we review here the hypothesis that, in many instances, the cause of these lipid abnormalities could be a dysregulation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (ampk)/malonyl coenzyme a (coa) fuel-sensing and signaling mechanism. such dysregulation could be reflected by isolated increases in malonyl coa or by concurrent changes in malonyl coa and ampk, both of which would alter intracellular fatty acid partitioning. the possibility is also raised that pharmacological agents and other factors that activate ampk and/or decrease malonyl coa could be therapeutic targets.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ does aspirin acetylate multiple cellular proteins? (review). aspirin is a salicylate drug that is extensively used for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and anti-thrombotic effects. more recently, it has been shown to decrease the incidence of cancers of epithelial origin. in most cases, aspirin is relatively safe. however, it does cause a host of adverse effects and toxicities, including gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerations, nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. although the inhibition of cyclooxygenases by aspirin, which leads to its anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties, has been well studied, the mechanisms involved in its chemopreventive effects as well as some of its adverse effects are as yet ill-defined. studies over the past decades suggest that, besides cyclooxygenases, aspirin acetylates other cellular proteins. these studies used radiolabeled 3h or 14c aspirin, the only approach used to date for the detection of proteins acetylated by aspirin. in a recent study using protein-specific anti-acetyl lysine antibodies and immunological methods, we demonstrated the ability of aspirin to acetylate the tumor suppressor protein p53. in this review, we present current research from the literature on the aspirin-induced acetylation of proteins. we also describe an immunological approach to detecting acetylated proteins in aspirin-treated cells, and demonstrate that multiple proteins are acetylated. since post-translational modification of proteins, such as acetylation, may lead to the alteration of their function, it is possible that some of the hitherto unexplained beneficial or adverse effects of aspirin could occur as a result of these modifications. the identification of these novel acetylation targets of aspirin represents a new area for investigation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ functional analyses of glycyl-trna synthetase mutations suggest a key role for trna-charging enzymes in peripheral axons. charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) and distal spinal muscular atrophy type v (dsma-v) are axonal neuropathies characterized by a phenotype that is more severe in the upper extremities. we previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-trna synthetase (gars) as the cause of cmt2d and dsma-v. gars is a member of the family of aminoacyl-trna synthetases responsible for charging trna with cognate amino acids; gars ligates glycine to trna(gly). here, we present functional analyses of disease-associated gars mutations and show that there are not any significant mutation-associated changes in gars expression levels; that the majority of identified gars mutations modeled in yeast severely impair viability; and that, in most cases, mutant gars protein mislocalizes in neuronal cells. indeed, four of the five mutations studied show loss-of-function features in at least one assay, suggesting that trna-charging deficits play a role in disease pathogenesis. finally, we detected endogenous gars-associated granules in the neurite projections of cultured neurons and in the peripheral nerve axons of normal human tissue. these data are particularly important in light of the recent identification of cmt-associated mutations in another trna synthetase gene [yars (tyrosyl-trna synthetase gene)]. together, these findings suggest that trna-charging enzymes play a key role in maintaining peripheral axons.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ antofine-induced connexin43 gap junction disassembly in rat astrocytes involves protein kinase cβ. antofine, a phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid derived from cryptocaryachinensis and ficusseptica in the asclepiadaceae milkweed family, is cytotoxic for various cancer cell lines. in this study, we demonstrated that treatment of rat primary astrocytes with antofine induced dose-dependent inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (gjic), as assessed by scrape-loading 6-carboxyfluorescein dye transfer. levels of cx43 protein were also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner following antofine treatment. double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that antofine (10ng/ml) induced endocytosis of surface gap junctions into the cytoplasm, where cx43 was co-localized with the early endosome marker eea1. inhibition of lysosomes or proteasomes by co-treatment with antofine and their respective specific inhibitors, nh4cl or mg132, partially inhibited the antofine-induced decrease in cx43 protein levels, but did not inhibit the antofine-induced inhibition of gjic. after 30min of treatment, antofine induced a rapid increase in the intracellular ca(2+) concentration and activation of protein kinase c (pkc)α/βii, which was maintained for at least 6h. co-treatment of astrocytes with antofine and the intracellular ca(2+) chelator bapta-am prevented downregulation of cx43 and inhibition of gjic. moreover, co-treatment with antofine and a specific pkcβ inhibitor prevented endocytosis of gap junctions, downregulation of cx43, and inhibition of gjic. taken together, these findings indicate that antofine induces cx43 gap junction disassembly by the pkcβ signaling pathway. inhibition of gjic by antofine may undermine the neuroprotective effect of astrocytes in cns.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ physiological oxygenation status is required for fully differentiated phenotype in kidney cortex proximal tubules. hypoxia has been suspected to trigger transdifferentiation of renal tubular cells into myofibroblasts in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt) process. to determine the functional networks potentially altered by hypoxia, rat renal tubule suspensions were incubated under three conditions of oxygenation ranging from normoxia (lactate uptake) to severe hypoxia (lactate production). transcriptome changes after 4 h were analyzed on a high scale by restriction fragment differential display. among 1,533 transcripts found, 42% were maximally expressed under severe hypoxia and 8% under mild hypoxia (po(2) = 48 mmhg), suggesting two different levels of oxygen sensing. normoxia was required for full expression of the proximal tubule-specific transcripts 25-hydroxyvitamin d 1-hydroxylase (cyp27b1) and l-pyruvate kinase (pklr), transcripts involved in tissue cohesion such as fibronectin (fn1) and n-cadherin (cdh2), and non-muscle-type myosin transcripts. mild hypoxia increased myogenin transcript level. conversely, severe hypoxia increased transcripts involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, those of muscle-type myosins, and others involved in creatine phosphate synthesis and lactate transport (slc16a7). accordingly, microscopy showed loss of tubule aggregation under hypoxia, without tubular disruption. hypoxia also increased the levels of kidney-specific transcripts normally restricted to the less oxygenated medullary zone and others specific for the distal part of the nephron. we conclude that extensive oxygen supply to the kidney tubule favors expression of its differentiated functions specifically in the proximal tubule, whose embryonic origin is mesenchymal. the phenotype changes could potentially permit transient adaptation to hypoxia but also favor pathological processes such as tissue invasion.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ profile of certolizumab and its potential in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis (psa) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis (pso). psa could be considered an enthesal disease because of the link between mechanical stress (entheses) and immunologically active tissue (synovium). evidence of efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) is supported by reduction of histological vascularity and immune cell infiltrates in synovial tissue after treatment. certolizumab pegol (czp) is a polyethylene glycolylated (pegylated) fab' fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes human tnf-alpha. the peg moiety of the fab fragment, markedly increases the half-life of czp and confers to the drug a unique structure that differs from the other anti-tnf-alpha agents tested for the treatment of crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis, nonradiographic spondyloarthritis, pso, and psa. in contrast to other anti-tnf-alpha agents, czp did not mediate increased levels of apoptosis, suggesting that these mechanisms are not essential for the anti-tnf-alpha efficacy in crohn's disease. as czp, infliximab, and adalimumab, but not etanercept, almost completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta release from monocytes, this cytokine-production inhibition may be relevant for drug efficacy. due to these characteristics, it has been demonstrated in clinical studies that czp effectively improves signs and symptoms of arthritis and physical function and skin manifestations of pso, with a safety profile similar to rheumatoid arthritis. this drug can be considered as a valid treatment in patients affected by psa. the efficacy and tolerability profiles suggest czp as a suitable antipsoriatic drug in the treatment of psa.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ acid-degradable cationic poly(ketal amidoamine) for enhanced rna interference in vitro and in vivo. efficient delivery of small interfering rna (sirna) is one of major challenges in the successful applications of sirna in clinic. in the present study, we report a new acid-degradable poly(ketal amidoamine) (pkaa) as a sirna carrier, which has high delivery efficiency and low cytotoxicity. pkaa was designed to have acid-cleavable ketal linkages in the backbone of cationic biodegradable poly(amidoamine). pkaa efficiently self-assembled with sirna to form nanocomplexes with a diameter of ~200 nm and slightly positive charges, which are stable under physiological conditions, but rapidly release sirna at acidic ph. pkaa exhibited sufficient buffering capability and endosomolytic activity due mainly to the presence of secondary amine groups in its backbone and rapid degradation in acidic endosomes, leading to the enhanced release of sirna to cytoplasm. cell culture studies demonstrated that pkaa is capable of delivering anti-tnf (tumor necrosis factor)-α sirna to lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated macrophages and significantly inhibits the expression of tnf-α. a mouse model of acetaminophen (apap)-induced acute liver failure was used to evaluate in vivo sirna delivery efficacy of pkaa. pkaa/anti-tnf-α sirna nanocomplexes significantly reduced the alt (alanine transaminase) and the hepatic cellular damages in apap-intoxicated mice. we anticipate that acid-degradable pkaa has great potential as sirna carriers based on its excellent biocompatibility, ph sensitivity, potential endosomolytic activity, and high delivery efficiency.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(-) epicatechin pretreatment showed significant protective effects on all the biochemical parameters evaluated. the in vitro study revealed the superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of (-) epicatechin. the possible mechanisms for the beneficial effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondria could be attributed to scavenging of free radicals, decreasing calcium, increasing multi-enzymes (antioxidant, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes), reduced glutathione and adenosine triphosphate. thus, (-) epicatechin attenuated mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities of non-small cell lung cancer-associated mutants of human epidermal growth factor receptor. the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) has an essential role in multiple signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and migration, through extracellular ligand binding and subsequent activation of its intracellular tyrosine kinase (tk) domain. the non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc)-associated egfr mutants, l858r and g719s, are constitutively active and oncogenic. they display sensitivity to tk inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib. in contrast, the secondary mutation of the gatekeeper residue, t790m, reportedly confers inhibitor resistance on the oncogenic egfr mutants. in this study, our biochemical analyses revealed that the introduction of the t790m mutation confers gefitinib resistance on the g719s mutant. the g719s/t790m double mutant has enhanced activity and retains high gefitinib-binding affinity. the t790m mutation increases the atp affinity of the g719s mutant, explaining the acquired drug resistance of the double mutant. structural analyses of the g719s/t790m double mutant, as well as the wild type and the g719s and l858r mutants, revealed that the t790m mutation stabilizes the hydrophobic spine of the active egfr-tk conformation. the met790 side chain of the g719s/t790m double mutant, in the apo form and gefitinib- and amppnp-bound forms, adopts different conformations that explain the accommodation of these ligands. in the l858r mutant structure, the active-site cleft is expanded by the repositioning of phe723 within the p-loop. notably, the introduction of the f723a mutation greatly enhanced the gefitinib sensitivity of the wild-type egfr in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that the expansion of the active-site cleft results in enhanced gefitinib sensitivity. taken together, our results provide a structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities caused by distinct nsclc-associated egfr mutations.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the role of de novo catecholamine synthesis in mediating methylmercury-induced vesicular dopamine release from rat pheochromocytoma (pc12) cells. the purpose of this study was to characterize methylmercury (mehg)-induced dopamine (da) release from undifferentiated pheochromocytoma (pc12) cells and to examine the potential role for da synthesis in this process. mehg caused a significant increase in da release that was both concentration- and time-dependent. da release was significantly increased by 2µm mehg at 60min and by 5µm mehg at 30min; 1µm mehg was without effect. because da release induced by 5µm mehg was associated with a significant percentage of cell death at 60 and 120min, 2µm mehg was chosen for further characterization of release mechanisms. mehg-induced da release was attenuated but not abolished in the absence of extracellular calcium, whereas the vesicular content depleting drug reserpine (50nm) abolished release. thus, mehg-induced da release requires vesicular exocytosis but not extracellular calcium. mehg also increased intracellular da and the rate of da storage utilization, suggesting a role for da synthesis in mehg-induced da release. the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor α-methyltyrosine (300µm, 24h) completely abolished mehg-induced da release. mehg significantly increased da precursor accumulation in cells treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (10µm), revealing that mehg increases tyrosine hydroxylase activity. overall, these data demonstrate that mehg facilitates da synthesis, increases intracellular da, and augments vesicular exocytosis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ further characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (putative 5-ht2b) in rat stomach fundus longitudinal muscle. 1. the present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize pharmacologically homogeneous populations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) receptors from a possible mixed receptor population mediating concentration of the longitudinal muscle of rat stomach fundus. our aim was to extend the pharmacological characterization of the 5-ht2b receptor which is reported to be expressed in this preparation. 2. to minimize spontaneous activity and any influence of circular muscle on the contractile response, narrow (1-1.5 x 20 mm) segments of mucosa-denuded longitudinal muscle were used. under these conditions, blockade of monoamine oxidase with pargyline (100 microm for 15 min) caused a leftward displacement of concentration-effect curves for both 5-methoxytryptamine (5-meo-t) and tryptamine. neither pargyline nor a number of uptake inhibitors affected responses to 5-ht. 3. in pargyline pretreated preparations, the order of potency of a number of tryptamine analogues was as follows: 5-meo-t > or = alpha-me-5-ht > or = 5-ht > 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct) > tryptamine > 2-me-5-ht. in addition several ligands known to act as agonists at either 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c receptors including 1-m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-cpp), ru 24969, mk 212 and sch 23390 were also agonists in rat fundus whilst sumatriptan, renzapride and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-oh-dpat) were very weak or inactive. with the exception of 2-me-5-ht and m-cpp, most agonists produced monophasic concentration-effect curves consistent with an interaction at a single site. high concentrations of 2-me-5-ht evoked relaxations which were blocked by phentolamine (1 microm) suggesting an interaction with alpha-adrenoceptors. m-cpp often evoked biphasic concentration-effect curves with a second contractile phase which was insensitive to yohimbine at concentrations higher than required for antagonism of responses to 5-ht.4. ly 53857, methiothepin, methysergide, ritanserin and ici 170809 were potent but non-surmountable antagonists of 5-ht in rat fundus. in contrast, several ligands behaved as surmountable antagonists with the following order of potency: rauwolscine >yohimbine = mesulergine > mianserin = sb 204070 >wy 26703 > sb 200646> pirenpirone> renzapride. dau 6285, granisetron, spiperone, ketanserin,phentolamine and gr 127935 did not affect responses to 5-ht at concentrations up to 1 pm. the agonist and concentration independent profile of antagonism supported a single site interaction for both agonists and antagonists.5. we conclude that despite small differences concerning the enantiomeric selectivity and affinity of rauwolscine and yohimbine, the close pharmacological identity of 5-ht receptors in rat stomach fundus and the recently cloned 5-ht2b receptor is maintained. sb 200646, which demonstrates some selectivity for 5-ht receptors in rat stomach fundus, should provide a useful ligand for confirmation of this view and allow discrimination of 5-ht2b function both in vitro and in vivo.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ mesenchymal cells regulate the response of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to asparaginase. because of their low asparagine synthetase (asns) expression and asparagine biosynthesis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) cells are exquisitely sensitive to asparagine depletion. consequently, asparaginase is a major component of all therapy, but the mechanisms regulating the susceptibility of leukemic cells to this agent are unclear. in 288 children with all, cellular asns expression was more likely to be high in t-lineage all and low in b-lineage all with tel-aml1 or hyperdiploidy. however, asns expression levels in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (mscs), which form the microenvironment where leukemic cells grow, were on average 20 times higher than those in all cells. mscs protected all cells from asparaginase cytotoxicity in coculture experiments. this protective effect correlated with levels of asns expression: downregulation by rna interference decreased the capacity of mscs to protect all cells from asparaginase, whereas enforced asns expression conferred enhanced protection. asparagine secretion by mscs was directly related to their asns expression levels, suggesting a mechanism - increased concentrations of asparagine in the leukemic cell microenvironment - for the protective effects we observed. these results provide what we believe to be a new basis for understanding asparaginase resistance in all and indicate that msc niches in the bone marrow can form a safe haven for leukemic cells.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ antiarrhythmic effects of (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, a novel sodium channel agonist in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ecg), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, has been proposed as an effective compound for improving cardiac contractility. however, the therapeutic potential of ecg on the treatment of arrhythmia remains unknown. we investigated the direct actions of ecg on the modulation of ion currents and cardiac cell excitability in the primary culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (nrvm), which is considered a hypertrophic model for analysis of myocardial arrhythmias. by using the whole-cell patch-clamp configurations, we found ecg enhanced the slowly inactivating component of voltage-gated na(+) currents (i(na)) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-100 μm) with an ec(50) value of 3.8 μm. ecg not only shifted the current-voltage relationship of peak i(na) to the hyperpolarizing direction but also accelerated i(na) recovery kinetics. working at a concentration level of i(na) enhancement, ecg has no notable effect on voltage-gated k(+) currents and l-type ca(2+) currents. with culture time increment, the firing rate of spontaneous action potential (sap) in nrvms was gradually decreased until spontaneous early after-depolarization (ead) was observed after about one week culture. ecg increased the firing rate of normal sap about two-fold without waveform alteration. interestingly, the bradycardia-dependent ead could be significantly restored by ecg in fast firing rate to normal sap waveform. the expression of dominant cardiac sodium channel subunit, nav1.5, was consistently detected throughout the culture periods. our results reveal how ecg, the novel i(na) agonist, may act as a promising candidate in clinical applications on cardiac arrhythmias.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ evaluation of the pharmacological selectivity profile of alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists at prostatic alpha 1 adrenoceptors: binding, functional and in vivo studies. 1. the profile of a range of alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in vitro against cloned human alpha 1a, alpha 1b and alpha 1d adrenoceptors and against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta and human prostate. the in vivo profile of compounds was determined in an anaesthetized dog model which allowed the simultaneous assessment of antagonist potency against phenylephrine-mediated increases in blood pressure and prostatic pressure. 2. the quinazoline antagonists, prazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin displayed high affinity but were non selective for the three cloned human alpha 1 adrenoceptors. indoramin and snap 1069 showed selectivity for alpha 1a and alpha 1b adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1d subtype. rec 15/2739, wb 4101, sl 89,0591, (+)- and (-)- tamsulosin showed selectivity for alpha 1a and alpha 1d adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1b subtype. rs 17053 showed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1a adrenoceptors (pki 8.6) relative to alpha 1b (pki = 7.3) and alpha 1d (pki = 7.1) subtypes. 3. (+)-tamsulosin, (-)-tamsulosin, sl 89,0591, rec 15/2739, snap 1069 and rs 17053 appeared to act as competitive antagonists of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta yielding pa2 affinity estimates which were similar to binding affinities at cloned human alpha 1d adrenoceptors. the following rank order was obtained: prazosin = (-)-tamsulosin > doxazosin > sl 89,0591 = (+)-tamsulosin > rec 15/2739 > rs 17053 = snap 1069. 4. (-)-tamsulosin was a very potent, insurmountable antagonist of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of human prostate, yielding an approximate pa2 estimate of 9.8 at 1 nm. the corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. sl 89,0591, snap 1069 and rec 15/2739 yielded pa2 estimates which compared well with their alpha 1a binding affinities. the affinity estimate for prazosin on human prostate was lower than the corresponding binding affinity determined at alpha 1a adrenoceptors and rs 17053 was a very weak antagonist on human prostate (pa2 = 6.0) relative to the high affinity (pki = 8.6) determined at cloned human alpha 1a adrenoceptors. 5. in the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo "pa2' values showed that doxazosin, (+)- and (-)-tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. sl 89,0591 and snap 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure. rec 15/2739 was a more potent antagonist of phenylephrine-mediated increases in prostatic pressure ("pa2' = 8.74) compared to blood pressure ("pa2' = 7.51). 6. data in this study suggest that the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contractions of human prostate, whilst having some of the characteristics of an alpha 1a adrenoceptor, cannot be satisfactorily aligned with cloned alpha 1a, alpha 1b or alpha 1d adrenoceptors. in addition, studies in the anaesthetized dog have shown that agents having high affinity and selectivity for prostatic alpha 1 adrenoceptors, particularly over the alpha 1d subtype, appear to inhibit phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic pressure selectively compared to blood pressure.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ increased urinary excretion of albumin, hemopexin, transferrin and vdbp correlates with chronic sensitization to gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats. drug nephrotoxicity is a serious health and economic problem worldwide. rats can be acutely sensitized to acute kidney injury (aki) by subnephrotoxic treatments with potentially nephrotoxic drugs. acquired sensitization to aki poses a silent risk impossible to diagnose pre-emptively with the technology available at the clinical level. herein, we hypothesized whether a chronic, subnephrotoxic insult to the kidneys might result in chronically acquired sensitization to aki, and whether chronic sensitization might be detected through specific urinary markers. to this end, rats were treated with a subtoxic dosage of the experimental nephrotoxin uranyl nitrate (un) in the drinking water for 21 weeks, or plain water (as control), and then with low-dose gentamicin for 7 days. renal function and renal tissue damage were evaluated through the experiment. the mild renal damage caused by gentamicin was markedly magnified in rats having received un chronically, which was evident both at the functional and histological level. four proteins, namely albumin, hemopexin, transferrin and vitamin d binding protein were increased in the urine in temporal association with the appearance of chronic predisposition. although further studies are necessary, our results suggest that these proteins might be potentially used as markers of hidden, chronic predisposition to gentamicin nephrotoxicity, in order to appropriately and pre-emptively stratify and handle individuals according to their specific risk in the long term, and to conveniently optimize their life conditions or additional clinical procedures or treatments that might trigger the disease. this might reduce aki incidence and severity and the associated costs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ update on rivastigmine. background: rivastigmine is a carbamate drug designed to inhibit both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase by reversibly covalently bonding to these enzymes. butyrylcholinesterase in-creases as alzheimer disease progresses, so its inhibition may become more important as the disease worsens. metabolism of rivastigmine occurs at the synapse rather than at the liver and previous studies have demonstrated no drug-drug interactions. rivastigmine has a half-life at the synapse of 9 hours allowing for bid dosing. review summary: effective therapy requires up-titration from initial dosage of 3 mg/d to 6 mg/d with additional increases to 9 mg or 12 mg/d giving additional benefits in some patients. beneficial effects with rivastigmine therapy in the functioning of activities of daily living, behavior, cognition, and global functioning have been demonstrated in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer disease in 4 large double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. potential adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in these original alzheimer trials with rapid (every week) dosage increases occurred in up to 34% of patients and can be minimized by slower monthly up-titrations. rivastigmine also was proven effective in decreasing psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits in a large double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with diffuse lewy body disease. other studies have suggested that rivastigmine improves symptoms in nursing home patients with more severe stage alzheimer disease, parkinson dementia, and subcortical dementia. follow-up studies have suggested that rivastigmine may delay disease progression and, in patients discontinuing the drug, no withdrawal effects were seen. conclusion: rivastigmine is an effective therapeutic agent for treating cognitive and behavioral symptoms in alzheimer disease and diffuse lewy body disease and may also have beneficial effects in vascular and parkinson dementias.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ nonsedating histamine h1-receptor antagonists. the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosages of the nonsedating histamine h1-receptor antagonists terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and acrivastine are reviewed. terfenadine and astemizole are chemically unrelated to histamine h1-receptor antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. loratadine is structurally related to the antihistamine azatadine, and acrivastine is a side-chain-reduced metabolite of the antihistamine triprolidine. like other histamine h1-receptor antagonists, they competitively block histamine receptor sites rather than inhibiting histamine release. all four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. terfenadine, astemizole, and loratadine are metabolized extensively in the liver; terfenadine and astemizole are both 97% protein bound. terfenadine 60 mg twice daily has been shown to be as effective as conventional antihistamines for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. in clinical trials, astemizole 10 mg daily was comparable to or better than chlorpheniramine for treatment of chronic rhinitis. both terfenadine and astemizole were effective for treatment of chronic urticaria. for treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, loratadine combined with pseudoephedrine may be preferable to triprolidine-pseudoephedrine and acrivastine-pseudoephedrine combinations that require more frequent dosing. acrivastine must be administered more frequently than the other nonsedating antihistamines. none of these four agents impairs psychomotor activity. infrequently reported adverse effects include dry mouth, skin reactions, and weight gain. the absence of substantial sedative effects and the less-frequent dosing schedules make these agents good alternatives to the classic antihistamines for treatment of seasonal and chronic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ auranofin, as an anti-rheumatic gold compound, suppresses lps-induced homodimerization of tlr4. toll-like receptors (tlrs), which are activated by invading microorganisms or endogenous molecules, evoke immune and inflammatory responses. tlr activation is closely linked to the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. auranofin, an au(i) compound, is a well-known and long-used anti-rheumatic drug. however, the mechanism as to how auranofin relieves the symptom of rheumatoid arthritis has not been fully clarified. our results demonstrated that auranofin suppressed tlr4-mediated activation of transcription factors, nf-kappab and irf3, and expression of cox-2, a pro-inflammatory enzyme. this suppression was well correlated with the inhibitory effect of auranofin on the homodimerization of tlr4 induced by an agonist. furthermore, auranofin inhibited nf-kappab activation induced by myd88-dependent downstream signaling components of tlr4, myd88, ikkbeta, and p65. irf3 activation induced by myd88-independent signaling components, trif and tbk1, was also downregulated by auranofin. our results first demonstrate that auranofin suppresses the multiple steps in tlr4 signaling, especially the homodimerization of tlr4. the results suggest that the suppression of tlr4 activity by auranofin may be the molecular mechanism through which auranofin exerts anti-rheumatic activity.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ corticotropin releasing factor and catecholamines enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala. glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala (cea) plays an important role in many behaviors including anxiety, memory consolidation and cardiovascular responses. while these behaviors can be modulated by corticotropin releasing factor (crf) and catecholamine signaling, the mechanism(s) by which these signals modify cea glutamatergic neurotransmission remains unclear. utilizing whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings from neurons in the lateral subdivision of the cea (ceal), we show that crf, dopamine (da) and the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (iso) all enhance the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sepsc) without altering sepsc kinetics, suggesting they increase presynaptic glutamate release. the effect of crf on sepscs was mediated by a combination of crfr1 and crfr2 receptors. while previous work from our lab suggests that crfrs mediate the effect of catecholamines on excitatory transmission in other subregions of the extended amygdala, blockade of crfrs in the ceal failed to significantly alter effects of da and iso on glutamatergic transmission. these findings suggest that catecholamine and crf enhancement of glutamatergic transmission onto ceal neurons occurs via distinct mechanisms. while crf increased spontaneous glutamate release in the ceal, crf caused no significant changes to optogenetically evoked glutamate release in this region. the dissociable effects of crf on different types of glutamatergic neurotransmission suggest that crf may specifically regulate spontaneous excitatory transmission.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ safety of selegiline (deprenyl) in the treatment of parkinson's disease. selegiline (deprenyl), a selective, irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type b (mao-b) is widely used in the treatment of parkinson's disease. as the first mao-b inhibitor approved for the treatment of parkinson's disease, concerns were raised about the safety of the drug based on the adverse effect profiles of older, nonselective mao inhibitors. unlike the nonselective mao inhibitors, selegiline does not significantly potentiate tyramine-induced hypertension (the 'cheese effect') at the dosages (5 to 10 mg daily) used for the treatment of parkinson's disease. selegiline has been well tolerated when given alone. the most frequent adverse events seen during monotherapy have been insomnia, nausea, benign cardiac arrhythmias, dizziness and headache. when combined with levodopa, selegiline can potentiate the typical adverse effects of levodopa, if the dose of levodopa is not reduced sufficiently. thus, the most common adverse effects associated with this combination are nausea, dizziness, fatigue, constipation and insomnia. at the later stages of parkinson's disease when fluctuations in disability occur, peak dose dyskinesias, psychiatric complications like hallucinations and insomnia, and orthostatic hypotension are further potentiated by selegiline. mortality was recently reported to be increased when selegiline and levodopa were given together in comparison with treatment with levodopa alone, but a large meta-analysis of 5 long term studies and 4 separate studies did not support this conclusion. selegiline seems to be generally well tolerated in combination with other drugs. however, when pethidine (meperidine) has been given to patients who are receiving selegiline therapy, severe adverse effects have been reported. thus, the concomitant use of these drugs is not recommended. a low tyramine diet is recommended if selegiline is used together with nonselective mao inhibitors or the selective, reversible mao-a inhibitor, moclobemide. several adverse effects have been reported when fluoxetine and selegiline have been used together. a recent survey revealed that the incidence of a true serotonin syndrome is, however, very low with this combination. concomitant use of selegiline and other selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) reuptake inhibitors (ssris) like citalopram, which have generally less interactions than fluoxetine, seems to be well tolerated. nevertheless, caution is advised when combining a ssri or a tricyclic antidepressant and selegiline.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ silibinin triggers apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest of sgc7901 cells. silibinin, a flavonoid compound, has shown to be of chemopreventive potential against many cancers. however, its efficacy against gastric cancer has not been well elucidated. here, we assessed the activity of silibinin on apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in human gastric cells culture system using sgc-7901 as the model. silibinin treatment could inhibit the cell growth and cause a prominent g2 phase arrest and apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner. in mechanistic studies, silibinin decreased the protein level of p34cdc2, which might be the possible molecular mechanism of silibinin efficacy on the growth inhibition in sgc-7901 cells. in addition, silibinin caused an increase in p53 and p21 protein level as well as mrna levels. interestingly, silibinin-induced apoptosis in sgc-7901 cells was independent of caspases activation. these results indicated that silibinin is a cell-cycle regulator and apoptosis inducer in human gastric carcinoma sgc-7901 cells and might be used as a candidate chemopreventive agent for gastric carcinoma prevention and intervention. copyright © 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ genome-wide screen for modulation of hepatic apolipoprotein a-i (apoa-i) secretion. control of plasma cholesterol levels is a major therapeutic strategy for management of coronary artery disease (cad). although reducing ldl cholesterol (ldl-c) levels decreases morbidity and mortality, this therapeutic intervention only translates into a 25-40% reduction in cardiovascular events. epidemiological studies have shown that a high ldl-c level is not the only risk factor for cad; low hdl cholesterol (hdl-c) is an independent risk factor for cad. apolipoprotein a-i (apoa-i) is the major protein component of hdl-c that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from tissues to the liver for excretion. therefore, increasing apoa-i levels is an attractive strategy for hdl-c elevation. using genome-wide sirna screening, targets that regulate hepatocyte apoa-i secretion were identified through transfection of 21,789 sirnas into hepatocytes whereby cell supernatants were assayed for apoa-i. approximately 800 genes were identified and triaged using a convergence of information, including genetic associations with hdl-c levels, tissue-specific gene expression, druggability assessments, and pathway analysis. fifty-nine genes were selected for reconfirmation; 40 genes were confirmed. here we describe the sirna screening strategy, assay implementation and validation, data triaging, and example genes of interest. the genes of interest include known and novel genes encoding secreted enzymes, proteases, g-protein-coupled receptors, metabolic enzymes, ion transporters, and proteins of unknown function. repression of farnesyltransferase (fnta) by sirna and the enzyme inhibitor manumycin a caused elevation of apoa-i secretion from hepatocytes and from transgenic mice expressing hapoa-i and cholesterol ester transfer protein transgenes. in total, this work underscores the power of functional genetic assessment to identify new therapeutic targets.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ampk is a negative regulator of the warburg effect and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. ampk is a metabolic sensor that helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis. despite evidence linking ampk with tumor suppressor functions, the role of ampk in tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism is unknown. here we show that ampk negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis (the warburg effect) in cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. genetic ablation of the α1 catalytic subunit of ampk accelerates myc-induced lymphomagenesis. inactivation of ampkα in both transformed and nontransformed cells promotes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, increased allocation of glucose carbon into lipids, and biomass accumulation. these metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (hif-1α), as silencing hif-1α reverses the shift to aerobic glycolysis and the biosynthetic and proliferative advantages conferred by reduced ampkα signaling. together our findings suggest that ampk activity opposes tumor development and that its loss fosters tumor progression in part by regulating cellular metabolic pathways that support cell growth and proliferation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ improving the tolerability of anticholinergic agents in the treatment of overactive bladder. pharmacological treatment for overactive bladder has centred around the interruption of the detrusor activity that is central to urge and incontinence symptoms. the majority of patients with this disorder are treated with antimuscarinic agents. these drugs have been demonstrated to improve urgency, frequency of micturition and urge incontinence, all of which are primary symptoms of overactive bladder; however, they are also commonly associated with anticholinergic adverse effects, most notably dry mouth. attempts to increase tolerability have included the development of advanced formulations that regulate release of the active ingredient and the development of pharmacological agents that target the desired bladder receptors more specifically and accurately. although all agents provide good efficacy, tolerability is greatly affected by the formulation used to deliver the active pharmacological agent, as well as the specificity of the targeted receptors. clinical trials involving a transdermal formulation of oxybutynin have shown that this delivery method may be associated with a lower incidence of anticholinergic adverse events compared with both the immediate-release and the extended-release oral formulations of traditional agents, as well as the most recently approved agents - trospium chloride, solifenacin and darifenacin. much is still being learned about the function and specificity of muscarinic receptors, which will support the development of agents with sustained efficacy and enhanced tolerability compared with the available formulations to date. these include the s-isomer of oxybutynin, as well as selective muscarinic m2 receptor antagonists.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ prohormone convertase-1 will process prorelaxin, a member of the insulin family of hormones. relaxin is a polypeptide hormone involved in remodeling of the birth canal during parturition. it is synthesized as a preprohormone precursor, which undergoes specific processing to form the mature two-chain disulfide-linked active species that is secreted by the cell. a major part of this processing requires endoproteolytic cleavage at specific pairs of basic amino acid residues, an event necessary for the maturation of a variety of important biologically active proteins, such as insulin and nerve growth factor. human type 2 preprorelaxin was coexpressed in human kidney 293 cells with the candidate prohormone convertase-processing enzymes mpc1 or mpc2, both cloned from the mouse pituitary tumor att-20 cell line, or with the yeast kex2 alpha-mating factor-converting enzyme from saccharomyces cerevisiae. prorelaxin expressed alone in 293 cells was secreted into the culture medium unprocessed. transient coexpression with mpc1 or kex2, but not with mpc2, resulted in the secretion of a low mol wt species with an electrophoretic mobility very similar, if not identical, to that of authentic mature relaxin purified from human placenta. this species was precipitable by monoclonal antibodies specific for relaxin and had a retention time on reverse phase hplc comparable to that of relaxin. its analysis by both electrospray and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry generated mass data that were consistent only with mature relaxin. the basic residues required for mpc1-dependent cleavage of prorelaxin are defined by site-directed mutagenesis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ imatinib mesylate (gleevec) enhances mature osteoclast apoptosis and suppresses osteoclast bone resorbing activity. recent studies have reported that imatinib mesylate, a kinase inhibitor that targets the intracellular tyrosine kinase bcr-abl and the platelet derived growth factor (pdgf) receptor, is an effective inhibitor of the macrophage colony stimulating factor (m-csf) receptor, c-fms. given that m-csf signalling through c-fms plays an important role in osteoclast biology, we speculated that blocking such a pathway with imatinib may modulate osteoclast activity. using a cell model of mature rabbit osteoclasts, we thus investigated the effect of imatinib on in vitro osteoclast apoptosis and bone resorbing activity. our findings demonstrate that imatinib dose-dependently stimulates osteoclast apoptosis, a phenomenon which is blocked by the caspase i inhibitor z-vad-fmk. the ability of imatinib to enhance osteoclast cell death was accompanied by a dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclast bone resorbing activity. imatinib was also found to inhibit m-csf-induced osteoclast survival as well as m-csf-induced osteoclast bone resorbing activity, but was without effect on interleukin 1alpha (il-1alpha) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand (rankl)-induced inhibition of osteoclasts apoptosis, further supporting the hypothesis that imatinib may affect mature osteoclasts through the inhibition of c-fms. taken together, these results suggest that imatinib could be of clinical value in treating diseases where bone destruction can occur due to excessive m-csf production such as osteoporosis, inflammatory-and tumor-induced osteolysis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibits the induction of nitric-oxide synthase in human astrocytes. gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of no and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (inos) in human u373mg astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of inos. inhibition of human inos promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated u373mg astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of inos. since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (ppar-alpha), we investigated the role of ppar-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of inos. gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (ppre)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of deltahppar-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human ppar-alpha. however, deltahppar-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of inos suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits inos independent of ppar-alpha. the human inos promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (irf-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (isre), signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) binding to gamma-activation site (gas), nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab), activator protein-1 (ap-1), and ccaat/enhancer-binding protein beta (c/ebpbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. the combination of interleukin (il)-1beta and ifn-gamma induced the activation of nf-kappab, ap-1, c/ebpbeta, and gas but not that of isre, suggesting that irf-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of inos in human astrocytes. interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of nf-kappab, ap-1, and c/ebpbeta but not that of gas in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. these results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of inos probably by inhibiting the activation of nf-kappab, ap-1, and c/ebpbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ probing for a hydrophobic a binding register in prostate-specific membrane antigen with phenylalkylphosphonamidates. to explore for the existence of an auxiliary hydrophobic binding register remote from the active site of psma a series of phenylalkylphosphonamidate derivatives of glutamic acid were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory potencies against psma. both the phenyl- and benzylphosphonamidates (1a and 1b) exhibited only modest inhibitory potency against. the phenethyl analog 1c was intermediate in inhibitory potency while inhibitors possessing a longer alkyl tether from the phenyl ring, resulted in markedly improved k(i) values. the greatest inhibitory potency was obtained for the inhibitors in which the phenyl ring was extended furthest from the central phosphorus (1f, n=5 and 1g, n=6). the slightly serrated pattern that emerged as the alkyl tether increased from three to six methylene units suggests that inhibitory potency is not simply correlated to increased hydrophobicity imparted by the phenylalkyl chain, but rather that one or more hydrophobic binding registers may exist remote from the substrate recognition architecture in the active site of psma.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(+/-)-tamsulosin effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine even after inactivation of alpha 1b-adrenoceptors by treatment with chlorethylclonidine, which is an indication that the (+/-)-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to chlorethylclonidine. (+/-)-tamsulosin, over the range of concentrations at which it antagonized the positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, did not affect the accumulation of [3h]inositol phosphates that was induced by 10 microm phenylephrine. oxymetazoline antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine in a competitive manner without affecting the accumulation of inositol monophosphate induced by phenylephrine. these results indicate that the positive inotropic effect, mediated via (+/-)-tamsulosin- and oxymetazoline-sensitive subtype of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, is exerted by a subcellular mechanism that is independent of the accumulation of inositol phosphates.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated disruption of contact inhibition is associated with connexin43 downregulation and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication. the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) contributes to the control of cell-to-cell communication, cell adhesion, migration or proliferation. in the present study, we investigated the regulation of connexin43 (cx43) and cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication (gjic) during the ahr-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells. the contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells, which is frequently abolished in cancer cells; however, the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood. disruption of contact inhibition, which was induced by toxic ahr ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial wb-f344 cells, reduced cx43 protein levels, possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation, significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated gjic, in an ahr-dependent manner. although both intracellular and membrane cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by tcdd, sirna-mediated cx43 knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells. our data suggest that downregulation of cx43/gjic in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition, which occurs at the post-transcriptional level. this process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication, thus suggesting that toxic ahr agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce gjic, two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ interactions of pgh synthase isozymes-1 and -2 with nsaids. there are two isozymes of prostaglandin endoperoxide (pgh) synthase (cyclooxygenase) called pgh synthase-1 and -2 or cox i and ii. both isozymes catalyze the same two reactions: oxygenation of arachidonate to yield pgg2 and reduction of pgg2 to pgh2. pgh synthase-1 is expressed constitutively and is found in most tissues. pgh synthase-2 is undetectable in most cells but can be induced in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, ovarian follicles, and macrophages by various mitogens, cytokines, and tumor promoters. pgh synthase-1 (pghs-1) has been presumed to be the site of action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids). however, the discovery of the second isozyme, pgh synthase-2 (pghs-2), and its association with inflammation has suggested that this latter enzyme may be the therapeutic target of nsaids functioning in their antiinflammatory capacities. we have cloned cdnas for murine pghs-1 and pghs-2, expressed these enzymes in cos-1 cells, and compared the relative sensitivities of the two isozymes to some common nsaids. indomethacin, piroxicam, and sulindac sulfide were found to preferentially inhibit pghs-1. ibuprofen and meclofenamate inhibit both enzymes with comparable potencies. 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid, the active metabolite of relafen, inhibits murine pghs-2 preferentially. aspirin irreversibly inhibits pghs-1, preventing this isozyme from forming pgh2 or any other oxygenated product; in contrast, aspirin treatment of pghs-2 causes this enzyme to form 15-hydroxy-5c,8c,11c,13t-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-hete) instead of pgh2. our results indicate mouse pghs-1 and pghs-2 are pharmacologically distinct. thus, it should be possible to develop agents highly selective for each pghs isozyme. pghs-2 is not expressed in stomach but is increased by inflammatory cytokines in cells such as macrophages. thus, a selective inhibitor of pghs-2 could be an antiinflammatory agent but without being ulcerogenic.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ the pure antiandrogen ru 23908 (anandron), a candidate of choice for the combined antihormonal treatment of prostatic cancer: a review. the nonsteroidal antiandrogen ru 23908 ( anandron ) weakly interacts with the prostatic cytosolic androgen receptor and shows a fast dissociation rate. when administered to immature castrated rats up to the daily dose of 100 mg/kg, it is devoid of any androgenic activity but efficiently blocks the growth-promoting activity of androgens on ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weight, thus showing the characteristics of a pure antiandrogen. in intact animals, on the other hand, the antiandrogen administered alone exerts only a partial inhibition of prostate and seminal vesicle weight. this is due to the property of the pure antiandrogen to neutralize the inhibitory feedback effect of androgens at the pituitary level on the lh responsiveness to lhrh, as illustrated in vitro in rat anterior pituitary cells in culture as well as in vivo in intact and castrated animals. in intact animals, neutralization of the inhibitory feedback action of endogenous androgens leads to an increased lh and testosterone secretion, which partly overcomes the direct action of the antiandrogen at the level of the prostate and seminal vesicles. in fact, the plasma testosterone concentration is more than doubled 6 hr after the administration of 10 mg of ru 23908 while plasma lh and testosterone levels are increased by 7- and 17-fold, respectively, after 14 days of similar daily treatment. efficient neutralization of the androgenic action at the prostatic level in intact animals thus requires prevention of this escape phenomenon through inhibition of lh secretion. although inhibition of lh release can be achieved by estrogen and progestins, an optimal inhibitory effect on the prostate is obtained by the combined administration of the antiandrogen with an lhrh agonist that causes a specific blockage of testicular androgen biosynthesis as well as an inhibition of the lh responsiveness to lhrh.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ mitochondrial arginase ii modulates nitric-oxide synthesis through nonfreely exchangeable l-arginine pools in human endothelial cells. reduced synthesis of nitric oxide (no) contributes to the endothelial dysfunction and may be related to limited availability of l-arginine, the common substrate of constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (nos) and cytosolic arginase i and mitochondrial arginase ii. to determine whether arginases modulate the endothelial no synthesis, we investigated the effects of the competitive arginase inhibitor n(omega)-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-noha) on the activity of nos, arginases, and l-arginine transporter and on no release at surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs). in unstimulated cells, nor-noha dose-dependently reduced the arginase activity with maximal inhibition at 20 microm. when huvecs were stimulated by thrombin without extracellular l-arginine, nor-noha dose-dependently increased the nos activity and the no release with maximal effects at 20 microm. extracellular l-arginine also dose-dependently increased no release and arginase activity. when huvecs were stimulated by thrombin in the presence of 100 microm l-arginine, nos activity and no release were similar in untreated and nor-noha-treated cells. however, despite activation of l-arginine uptake, the inhibition of arginase activity by nor-noha was still significant. the depletion of freely exchangeable l-arginine pools with extracellular l-lysine did not prevent nor-noha from increasing the no release. this indicates the presence of pools, which are accessible to nos and arginase, but not exchangeable. interestingly, the mitochondrial arginase ii was constitutively expressed, whereas the cytosolic arginase i was barely detectable in huvecs. these data suggest that endothelial no synthesis depends on the activity of arginase ii in mitochondria and l-arginine carriers in cell membrane.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ inhibition of the uterotropic activity of estrogens and antiestrogens by the short acting antiestrogen ly117018. the aim of the study was to determine whether the dihydroxylated antiestrogen ly117018, with a high affinity for the estrogen receptor and low intrinsic estrogenic activity, could inhibit the uterotropic actions of steroidal [estradiol-17 beta (e2)] and nonsteroidal [ici 3188 and trianisylchloroethylene (tace)] estrogens in immature rats and also the uterotropic actions of tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in the ovariectomized mouse and immature rat. in the first series of experiments, ly117018 was compared with monohydroxytamoxifen. both antiestrogens inhibited the uterotropic actions of e2 (0.32 micrograms daily), ici 3188 (5 micrograms daily), and tace (40 and 160 micrograms daily) in a dose-related manner (0.32-82 micrograms daily). the potency of the antiestrogens against e2 and ici 3188 was similar, however, at higher doses (20.48 and 82 micrograms daily) ly117018 reduced uterine weights to below the lowest level achieved by monohydroxytamoxifen. in contrast, ly117018 was less effective against the long acting estrogen tace. the competitive interaction of ly117018 with tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen was compared in 3-day ovariectomized mouse and immature rat uterine weight tests. tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen were fully estrogenic in the mouse (5 micrograms daily) and partially estrogenic in the rat (1.5-20 micrograms daily). ly117018 was a partial estrogen in the mouse and a weekly active partial estrogen in the rat (2.5-120 micrograms daily). ly117018 produced dose-related decreases in the uterine weight increases induced by tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in both species. however, in the rat, ly117018 was more effective against the less potent compound tamoxifen, at a 6:1 dosage ratio compared with a 24:1 dosage ratio required for the potent compound monohydroxytamoxifen. ly117018 had a short duration of action as an antiestrogen when compared with monohydroxytamoxifen. ly117018 (120 micrograms) was only completely effective as an antiestrogen if administered repeatedly with e2 whereas a single injection of monohydroxytamoxifen (120 micrograms) was sufficient to inhibit fully e2 action in the uterus for up to 4 days. because ly117018 has a shorter duration of action than monohydroxytamoxifen, a high dosage ratio of ly117018 over monohydroxytamoxifen is required to maintain effective competitive antagonism in the uterus. overall, these findings suggest that monohydroxytamoxifen and ly117018 probably act through the same mechanism of action via the estrogen receptor.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ assessment of the abuse liability of abt-288, a novel histamine h3 receptor antagonist. rationale: histamine h3 receptor antagonists, such as abt-288, have been shown to possess cognitive-enhancing and wakefulness-promoting effects. on the surface, this might suggest that h3 antagonists possess psychomotor stimulant-like effects and, as such, may have the potential for abuse. objectives: the aim of the present study was to further characterize whether abt-288 possesses stimulant-like properties and whether its pharmacology gives rise to abuse liability. methods: the locomotor-stimulant effects of abt-288 were measured in mice and rats, and potential development of sensitization was addressed. drug discrimination was used to assess amphetamine-like stimulus properties, and drug self-administration was used to evaluate reinforcing effects of abt-288. the potential development of physical dependence was also studied. results: abt-288 lacked locomotor-stimulant effects in both rats and mice. repeated administration of abt-288 did not result in cross-sensitization to the stimulant effects of d-amphetamine in mice, suggesting that there is little overlap in circuitries upon which the two drugs interact for motor activity. abt-288 did not produce amphetamine-like discriminative stimulus effects in drug discrimination studies nor was it self-administered by rats trained to self-administer cocaine. there were no signs of physical dependence upon termination of repeated administration of abt-288 for 30 days. conclusions: the sum of these preclinical data, the first of their kind applied to h3 antagonists, indicates that abt-288 is unlikely to possess a high potential for abuse in the human population and suggests that h3 antagonists, as a class, are similar in this regard.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ different responses to dexamethasone and prednisolone in the same depressed patients. rationale: patients with major depression show hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis hyperactivity, but the mechanisms underlying this abnormality are still unclear. objectives: we have compared two synthetic glucorticoids, dexamethasone and prednisolone, in their ability to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis in depressed patients. dexamethasone probes glucocorticoid receptor (gr) function, while prednisolone probes both gr and mineralocorticoid receptor (mr) function. materials and methods: we used a single-blind, repeated-measure design. we administered placebo, prednisolone (5 mg) or dexamethasone (0.5 mg), at 22:00, to 18 severe, treatment-resistant depressed inpatients (15 of them with a history of childhood trauma) and 14 healthy volunteers. on the following days, we collected salivary cortisol from 9:00 to 22:00. results: depressed patients had higher salivary cortisol levels compared with controls, at baseline and after both prednisolone and dexamethasone (p<0.001). consistent with previous studies, depressed inpatients showed impaired suppression by dexamethasone: based on the analysis of the areas under the curve (aucs), suppression by dexamethasone (0.5 mg) was -85% in controls vs -46% in depressed patients (p=0.018). however, the same depressed patients showed normal suppression by prednisolone (5 mg): suppression was -41% in controls and -36% in depressed patients (p=0.6). conclusions: we suggest that the additional effects of prednisolone on the mr explain the different responses to these glucocorticoids in the same depressed patients.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ dissociation of bcl-2-beclin1 complex by activated ampk enhances cardiac autophagy and protects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetes. diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with suppression of cardiac autophagy, and activation of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) restores cardiac autophagy and prevents cardiomyopathy in diabetic mice, albeit by an unknown mechanism. we hypothesized that ampk-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of ampk on the interaction between beclin1 and bcl-2, a switch between autophagy and apoptosis, in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated h9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. exposure of h9c2 cells to high glucose reduced ampk activity, inhibited jun nh2-terminal kinase 1 (jnk1)-b-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) signaling, and promoted beclin1 binding to bcl-2. conversely, activation of ampk by metformin stimulated jnk1-bcl-2 signaling and disrupted the beclin1-bcl-2 complex. activation of ampk, which normalized cardiac autophagy, attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured h9c2 cells. this effect was attenuated by inhibition of autophagy. finally, chronic administration of metformin in diabetic mice restored cardiac autophagy by activating jnk1-bcl-2 pathways and dissociating beclin1 and bcl-2. the induction of autophagy protected against cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure and function in diabetic mice. we concluded that dissociation of bcl-2 from beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via ampk activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ fingolimod protects cultured cortical neurons against excitotoxic death. fingolimod (fty720), a novel drug approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, activates different sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (s1pr) subtypes. its primary mechanism of action is to reduce the egress of t lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs, thus restraining neuroinflammation and autoimmunity. however, recent evidence suggests that the action of fty720 involves s1prs expressed by cells resident in the cns, including neurons. here, we examined the effect of fty720, its active metabolite, fty720-p, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) on neuronal viability using a classical in vitro model of excitotoxic neuronal death. mixed cultures of mouse cortical cells were challenged with toxic concentrations of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) for 10 min, and neuronal death was assessed 20 h later. fty720, fty720-p, and s1p were all neuroprotective when applied 18-20 h prior to the nmda pulse. neuroprotection was attenuated by pertussis toxin, and inhibited by the selective type-1 s1pr (s1p1r) antagonist, w146, and by inhibitors of the mitogen associated protein kinase (mapk) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (ptdins-3-k) pathways. both fty720 and fty720-p retained their protective activity in pure cultures of mouse or rat cortical neurons. these data offer the first direct demonstration that fty720 and its active metabolite protect neurons against excitotoxic death.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ depletion of molecular chaperones from the endoplasmic reticulum and fragmentation of the golgi apparatus associated with pathogenesis in pelizaeus-merzbacher disease. missense mutations in the proteolipid protein 1 (plp1) gene cause a wide spectrum of hypomyelinating disorders, from mild spastic paraplegia type 2 to severe pelizaeus-merzbacher disease (pmd). mutant plp1 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and induces er stress. however, the link between the clinical severity of pmd and the cellular response induced by mutant plp1 remains largely unknown. accumulation of misfolded proteins in the er generally leads to up-regulation of er chaperones to alleviate er stress. here, we found that expression of the plp1-a243v mutant, which causes severe disease, depletes some er chaperones with a kdel (lys-asp-glu-leu) motif, in hela cells, mo3.13 oligodendrocytic cells, and primary oligodendrocytes. the same plp1 mutant also induces fragmentation of the golgi apparatus (ga). these organelle changes are less prominent in cells with milder disease-associated plp1 mutants. similar changes are also observed in cells expressing another disease-causing gene that triggers er stress, as well as in cells treated with brefeldin a, which induces er stress and ga fragmentation by inhibiting ga to er trafficking. we also found that mutant plp1 disturbs localization of the kdel receptor, which transports the chaperones with the kdel motif from the ga to the er. these data show that plp1 mutants inhibit ga to er trafficking, which reduces the supply of er chaperones and induces ga fragmentation. we propose that depletion of er chaperones and ga fragmentation induced by mutant misfolded proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of inherited er stress-related diseases and affect the disease severity.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ in vivo comparison of the reinforcing and dopamine transporter effects of local anesthetics in rhesus monkeys. dopaminergic mechanisms are thought to play a central role in the reinforcing effects of cocaine. similar to cocaine, other local anesthetics bind to the dopamine transporter (dat) and inhibit da uptake in rodent and monkey brain. additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse liability. the present study examined the reinforcing and dat effects of the local anesthetics dimethocaine, procaine and cocaine using in vivo techniques. monkeys were trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. cocaine administration (0.10 or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). when responding was stable, dimethocaine (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/ infusion) or procaine (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the cocaine training dose. dimethocaine administration produced higher response rates compared with that of procaine, and was a more potent reinforcer. drug effects on behavior were related to dat occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (pet). dat occupancy was determined by displacement of 8-(2-[(18)f]fluroethyl)2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (fecnt). dat occupancy was between 66 and 82% and <10-41% for doses of dimethocaine and procaine that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. finally, in vivo microdialysis in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular da in the caudate nucleus. there was close correspondence between peak increases in da and dat occupancy. overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with dat effects determined with in vivo techniques. the results further support a role for the dat in the abuse liability of local anesthetics.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ brain but not spinal nr2b receptor is responsible for the anti-allodynic effect of an nr2b subunit-selective antagonist cp-101,606 in a rat chronic constriction injury model. in order to examine the site of action of an nr2b subtype-selective nmda antagonist cp-101,606, we investigated its analgesic effect in a rat model of neuropathic pain at various routes of administration. mechanical allodynia was induced by chronic constriction injury (cci) of the sciatic nerve in male sprague-dawley rats. subcutaneous treatment of the animals with cp-101,606 at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited cci-induced mechanical allodynia. intracerebroventricular injection of cp-101,606 at 10, 30 and 100 nmol also inhibited the mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, the statistically significant effect being achieved at the highest dose tested (100 nmol) without producing any behavioral abnormalities. however, intrathecal injection of cp-101,606 at a dose of 300 nmol failed to inhibit cci-induced allodynia. a receptor binding assay using rat forebrain and spinal cord membrane preparations demonstrated that [3h]cp-101,606 bound to the brain nr2b receptor with a greater extent compared to the spinal cord one. these findings suggest that the anti-allodynia effect of cp-101,606 is ascribable to blockade of nr2b receptors at the brain, but not at the spinal cord. in contrast, intrathecal injection of a non-selective nmda antagonist, memantine, significantly inhibited cci-induced mechanical allodynia at a dose of 300 nmol, indicating the difference in the site of action between the non-selective nmda antagonist and the nr2b-specific nmda antagonist.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cis-silencing of pip5k1b evidenced in friedreich's ataxia patient cells results in cytoskeleton anomalies. friedreich's ataxia (frda) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by ataxia, variously associating heart disease, diabetes mellitus and/or glucose intolerance. it results from intronic expansion of gaa triplet repeats at the fxn locus. homozygous expansions cause silencing of the fxn gene and subsequent decreased expression of the encoded mitochondrial frataxin. detailed analyses in fibroblasts and neuronal tissues from frda patients have revealed profound cytoskeleton anomalies. so far, however, the molecular mechanism underlying these cytoskeleton defects remains unknown. we show here that gene silencing spreads in cis over the pip5k1b gene in cells from frda patients (circulating lymphocytes and primary fibroblasts), correlating with expanded gaa repeat size. pip5k1b encodes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase β type i (pip5k1β), an enzyme functionally linked to actin cytoskeleton dynamics that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [pi(4)p] to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [pi(4,5)p2]. accordingly, loss of pip5k1β function in frda cells was accompanied by decreased pi(4,5)p2 levels and was shown instrumental for destabilization of the actin network and delayed cell spreading. knockdown of pip5k1b in control fibroblasts using shrna reproduced abnormal actin cytoskeleton remodeling, whereas over-expression of pip5k1b, but not fxn, suppressed this phenotype in frda cells. in addition to provide new insights into the consequences of the fxn gene expansion, these findings raise the question whether pip5k1b silencing may contribute to the variable manifestation of this complex disease.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ bupropion inhibits nicotine-evoked [(3)h]overflow from rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)h]dopamine and from rat hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)h]norepinephrine. bupropion, an efficacious antidepressant and smoking cessation agent, inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (dat and net, respectively). recently, bupropion has been reported to noncompetitively inhibit alpha3beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) expressed in xenopus oocytes or established cell lines. the present study evaluated bupropion-induced inhibition of native alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nachrs using functional neurotransmitter release assays, nicotine-evoked [(3)h]overflow from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)h]dopamine ([(3)h]da), and nicotine-evoked [(3)h]overflow from hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)h]norepinephrine ([(3)h]ne). the mechanism of inhibition was evaluated using schild analysis. to eliminate the interaction of bupropion with dat or net, nomifensine or desipramine, respectively, was included in the superfusion buffer. a high bupropion concentration (100 microm) elicited intrinsic activity in the [(3)h]da release assay. however, none of the concentrations (1 nm-100 microm) examined evoked [(3)h]ne overflow and, thus, were without intrinsic activity in this assay. moreover, bupropion inhibited both nicotine-evoked [(3)h]da overflow (ic(50) = 1.27 microm) and nicotine-evoked [(3)h]ne overflow (ic(50) = 323 nm) at bupropion concentrations well below those eliciting intrinsic activity. results from schild analyses suggest that bupropion competitively inhibits nicotine-evoked [(3)h]da overflow, whereas evidence for receptor reserve was obtained upon assessment of bupropion inhibition of nicotine-evoked [(3)h]ne overflow. thus, bupropion acts as an antagonist at alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nachrs in rat striatum and hippocampus, respectively, across the same concentration range that inhibits dat and net function. the combination of nachr and transporter inhibition produced by bupropion may contribute to its clinical efficacy as a smoking cessation agent.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ comparison of inhibitory effects of meloxicam and diclofenac on human thromboxane biosynthesis after single doses and at steady state. objective: to evaluate the extent of human cyclooxygenase-1 (cox-1) inhibition by meloxicam, which has been reported to preferentially inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2). the effects of meloxicam were compared with those of diclofenac, a nonselective cox inhibitor. methods: cox-1 inhibition was determined by measuring thromboxane b2 (txb2)-generation from clotting whole blood ex vivo after single oral doses of 7.5 and 15 mg meloxicam and 75 mg diclofenac and at steady state (15 mg meloxicam daily and 150 mg diclofenac daily). the effect was expressed as percentage inhibition of serum txb2 generation and was directly related to the serum drug concentration with use of a standard sigmoidal e(max) model. results: in terms of inhibition of txb2 generation, diclofenac was about 1 order of magnitude more potent than meloxicam, indicated by a diclofenac ec50 (concentration of drug required to cause 50% of maximum effect) that was about 10 times lower than that of meloxicam (ec50 diclofenac single doses: 37.50+/-29.64; ec50 meloxicam single doses: 677.50+/-189.08). however, serum concentrations of meloxicam after administration of 15 mg were approximately 10-fold higher than those of diclofenac. therefore there was no statistically significant difference in the area under the effect time curve (p = .115) and the mean effect (p = .424) between meloxicam and diclofenac. the ec50 of both drugs was significantly higher at steady state (diclofenac steady state: 87.07+/-55.24 ng/ml; meloxicam steady state: 1850.12+/-829.93 ng/ml) than after a single dose (p < .001). conclusion: these data show that meloxicam inhibits txb2 generation at clinically relevant doses, although less potently than diclofenac. thus our data suggest that the cox-2 preference of meloxicam observed in vitro may not result in clinical advantages when the higher dose of 15 mg is needed. because of the increase in ec50 at steady state, cox-1 is relatively spared when the lower dose of 7.5 mg is administered.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ long range effect of mutations on specific conformational changes in the extracellular loop 2 of angiotensin ii type 1 receptor. the topology of the second extracellular loop (ecl2) and its interaction with ligands is unique in each g protein-coupled receptor. when the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane (tm) domain is occupied, ligand-specific conformational changes occur in the ecl2. in more than 90% of g protein-coupled receptors, ecl2 is tethered to the third tm helix via a disulfide bond. therefore, understanding the extent to which the tm domain and ecl2 conformations are coupled is useful. to investigate this, we examined conformational changes in ecl2 of the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor (at1r) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the at1r. differential accessibility of reporter cysteines introduced at four conformation-sensitive sites in ecl2 of these mutants was measured. binding of the agonist angiotensin ii (angii) and inverse agonist losartan in wild-type at1r changed the accessibility of reporter cysteines, and the pattern was consistent with ligand-specific "lid" conformations of ecl2. without agonist stimulation, the ecl2 in the gain of function mutant n111g assumed a lid conformation similar to angii-bound wild-type at1r. in the presence of inverse agonists, the conformation of ecl2 in the n111g mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild-type at1r. in contrast, angii did not induce a lid conformation in ecl2 in the loss of function d281a mutant, which is consistent with the reduced angii binding affinity in this mutant. however, a lid conformation was induced by [sar(1),gln(2),ile(8)] angii, a specific analog that binds to the d281a mutant with better affinity than angii. these results provide evidence for the emerging paradigm of domain coupling facilitated by long range interactions at distant sites on the same receptor.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ molecular determinants of dofetilide block of herg k+ channels. the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) encodes a k+ channel with biophysical properties nearly identical to the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier k+ current (ikr). herg/ikr channels are a prime target for the pharmacological management of arrhythmias and are selectively blocked by class iii antiarrhythmic methanesulfonanilide drugs, such as dofetilide, e4031, and mk-499, at submicromolar concentrations. by contrast, the closely related bovine ether-a-go-go channel (beag) is 100-fold less sensitive to dofetilide. to identify the molecular determinants for dofetilide block, we first engineered chimeras between herg and beag and then used site-directed mutagenesis to localize single amino acid residues responsible for block. using constructs heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes, we found that transplantation of the s5-s6 linker from beag into herg removed high-affinity block by dofetilide. a point mutation in the s5-s6 linker region, herg s620t, abolished high-affinity block and interfered with c-type inactivation. thus, our results indicate that important determinants of dofetilide binding are localized to the pore region of herg. since the loss of high-affinity drug binding was always correlated with a loss of c-type inactivation, it is possible that the changes observed in drug binding are due to indirect allosteric modifications in the structure of the channel protein and not to the direct interaction of dofetilide with the respective mutated site chains. however, the chimeric approach was not able to identify domains outside the s5-s6 linker region of the herg channel as putative candidates involved in drug binding. moreover, the reverse mutation beag t432s increased the affinity of beag k+ channels for dofetilide, whereas c-type inactivation could not be recovered. thus, the serine in position herg 620 may participate directly in dofetilide binding; however, an intact c-type inactivation process seems to be crucial for high-affinity drug binding.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ selective costimulation modulators: a novel approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. t cells have a central role in the orchestration of the immune pathways that contribute to the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). the requirement for a dual signal for t-cell activation and the construction of a fusion protein that prevents engagement of the costimulatory molecules required for this activation has led to a new approach to ra therapy. this approach is mechanistically distinct from other currently used therapies; it targets events early rather than late in the immune cascade, and it results in immunomodulation rather than complete immunosuppression. the fusion protein abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator that avidly binds to the cd80/cd86 ligands on an antigen-presenting cell, resulting in the inability of these ligands to engage the cd28 receptor on the t cell. abatacept dose-dependently reduces t-cell proliferation, serum concentrations of acute-phase reactants, and other markers of inflammation, including the production of rheumatoid factor by b cells. recent studies have provided consistent evidence that treatment with abatacept results in a rapid onset of efficacy that is maintained over the course of treatment in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies. this efficacy includes patient-centered outcomes and radiographic measurement of disease progression. abatacept has also demonstrated a very favorable safety profile to date. this article reviews the rationale for this therapeutic approach and highlights some of the recent studies that demonstrate the benefits obtained by using abatacept. this clinical experience indicates that abatacept is a significant addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of patients with ra.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ purification and structural characterisation of phospholipase a1 (vespapase, ves a 1) from thai banded tiger wasp (vespa affinis) venom. the thai banded tiger wasp (vespa affinis) is one of the most dangerous vespid species in southeast asia, and stinging accidents involving this species still cause fatalities. in the present study, four forms of v. affinis phospholipase a(1) were identified through a proteomics approach. two of these enzymes were purified by reverse-phase chromatography, and their biochemical properties were characterised. these enzymes, designated ves a 1s, are not glycoproteins and exist as 33441.5 and 33474.4 da proteins, which corresponded with the 34-kda band observed via sds-page. the thermal stabilities of these enzymes were stronger than snake venom. using an in vivo assay, no difference was found in the toxicities of the different isoforms. furthermore, the toxicity of these enzymes does not appear to be correlated with their pla(1) activity. the cdnas of the full-length version of ves a 1s revealed that the ves a 1 gene consists of a 1005-bp orf, which encodes 334 amino acid residues, and 67- and 227-bp 5' and 3' utrs, respectively. the two isoforms are different by three nucleotide substitutions, resulting in the replacement of two amino acids. through sequence alignment, these enzymes were classified as members of the pancreatic lipase family. the structural modelling of ves a 1 used the rat pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (1bu8a) as a template because it has pla(1) activity, which demonstrated that this enzyme belongs to the α/β hydrolase fold family. the ves a 1 structure, which is composed of seven α-helixes and eleven β-strands, contains the β-strand/ɛser/α-helix structural motif, which contains the gly-x-ser-x-gly consensus sequence. the typical surface structures that play important roles in substrate selectivity (the lid domain and the β9 loop) were shortened in the ves a 1 structure, which suggests that this enzyme may only exhibit phospholipase activity. moreover, the observed insertion of proline into the lid domain of the ves a 1 structure is rare. we therefore propose that this proline residue might be involved in the stability and activity of ves a 1s.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ protective effect of vitamin e and epicatechin against nicotine-induced oxidative stress in rats. nicotine is a major pharmacologically active and addictive component of tobacco smoke, which is regarded to be a primary risk factor in the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human diet. particularly high levels of this compound are found in tea, apples and chocolate. it has been reported that tea extracts and/or its constituents have antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, antitumor and antimutagenic activities. vitamin e is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin and free radical scavenger, presents as an integral component of cellular membranes and has important biological functions. the primary mechanism by which vitamin e is proposed to prevent cancer is through their antioxidant properties. the goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of epicatechin alone or combined with vitamin e in inhibiting the oxidative stress induced by nicotine in rats. results obtained indicated that there was a significant elevation in the levels of malondialdhyde (mda) in nicotine injected rats. the combined treatment (epicatechin + vit e) group showed a potential reduction of these parameters more than individual treatment. the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were found significantly higher in combined treated than untreated rats. in nicotine group, a negative significant correlation between reduced glutathione and mda (r = -0.92) was observed. in conclusion, these results suggested that the supplementation of diet with epicatechin and vitamin e provided antioxidant defense with strong chemopreventive activity against nicotine-induced carcinogenesis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ g6pc2: a negative regulator of basal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. elevated fasting blood glucose (fbg) is associated with increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular-associated mortality. genome-wide association studies (gwas) have linked polymorphisms in g6pc2 with variations in fbg and body fat, although not insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance. g6pc2 encodes an islet-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-resident glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. a combination of in situ perfused pancreas, in vitro isolated islet, and in vivo analyses were used to explore the function of g6pc2 in mice. g6pc2 deletion had little effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, whereas body fat was reduced in female g6pc2 knockout (ko) mice on both a chow and high-fat diet, observations that are all consistent with human gwas data. g6pc2 deletion resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (gsis). as a consequence, under fasting conditions in which plasma insulin levels were identical, blood glucose levels were reduced in g6pc2 ko mice, again consistent with human gwas data. glucose-6-phosphatase activity was reduced, whereas basal cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated in islets isolated from g6pc2 ko mice. these data suggest that g6pc2 represents a novel, negative regulator of basal gsis that acts by hydrolyzing glucose-6-phosphate, thereby reducing glycolytic flux.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ carvedilol modulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor in a rat model of volume-overload heart failure. background: the use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for congestive heart failure. hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (hif-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. however, the expression of hif-1alpha in chronic heart failure resulting from volume overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. methods and results: to test the hypothesis that hif-1alpha plays a role in the failing myocardium because of volume overload, an aorta-caval shunt was created for 4 weeks in adult sprague-dawley rats to induce volume-overload heart failure. carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. the heart weight and body weight ratio increased from 2.6 +/- 0.3 in the sham group to 3.9 +/- 0.7 (p < .001) in the shunt group. left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 6.5 +/- 0.5 mm to 8.7 +/- 0.6 mm (p < .001). treatment with carvedilol in the shunt group reversed the heart weight and ventricular dimension to the baseline values. western blot showed that hif-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) proteins were upregulated and nerve growth factor-beta (ngf-beta) downregulated in the shunt group. real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mrna of hif-1alpha, vegf, and bnp increased and mrna of ngf-beta decreased in the shunt group. treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mrna of hif-1alpha, vegf, bnp, and ngf-beta to the baseline values. increased immunohistochemical labeling of hif-1alpha, vegf, and bnp in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the shunt group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. conclusion: hif-1alpha and vegf mrna and protein expression were upregulated in the rat model of volume-overload heart failure. treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of hif-1alpha and vegf in the failing ventricular myocardium.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ molecular mechanism of terbinafine resistance in saccharomyces cerevisiae. ten mutants of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to the antimycotic terbinafine were isolated after chemical or uv mutagenesis. molecular analysis of these mutants revealed single base pair exchanges in the erg1 gene coding for squalene epoxidase, the target of terbinafine. the mutants did not show cross-resistance to any of the substrates of various pleiotropic drug resistance efflux pumps tested. the erg1 mrna levels in the mutants did not differ from those in the wild-type parent strains. terbinafine resistance was transmitted with the mutated alleles in gene replacement experiments, proving that single amino acid substitutions in the erg1 protein were sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype. the amino acid changes caused by the point mutations were clustered in two regions of the erg1 protein. seven mutants carried the amino acid substitutions f402l (one mutant), f420l (one mutant), and p430s (five mutants) in the c-terminal part of the protein; and three mutants carried an l251f exchange in the central part of the protein. interestingly, all exchanges identified involved amino acids which are conserved in the squalene epoxidases of yeasts and mammals. two mutations that were generated by pcr mutagenesis of the erg1 gene and that conferred terbinafine resistance mapped in the same regions of the erg1 protein, with one resulting in an l251f exchange and the other resulting in an f433s exchange. the results strongly indicate that these regions are responsible for the interaction of yeast squalene epoxidase with terbinafine.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ simvastatin regulates non-neuronal cholinergic activity in t lymphocytes via cd11a-mediated pathways. lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (lfa-1; cd11a/cd18) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and t cell activation. we previously showed that antithymocyte globulin stimulates an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system in t cells via lfa-1-mediated pathways, as evidenced by increases in acetylcholine (ach) synthesis and choline acetyltransferase (chat) mrna expression. the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits lfa-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on cd11a (lfa-1 alpha chain), which leads to immunomodulation. in the present study, we investigated whether simvastatin modulates lymphocytic cholinergic activity in t cells. we found that anti-cd11a monoclonal antibody (mab) increased chat activity, ach synthesis and release, and expression of chat and m5 muscarinic ach receptor mrna in molt-3 cells, a human leukemic t cell line. simvastatin abolished these anti-cd11a mab-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. these results indicate that lfa-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via cd11a-mediated pathways, and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the serotonin transporter polymorphism, 5httlpr, is associated with a faster response time to sertraline in an elderly population with major depressive disorder. rationale: a common polymorphism (5httlpr) within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (lsc6a4) has been shown to influence response time as well as overall response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) in subjects with major depressive disorder. we hypothesized that a similar effect in response time to sertraline would be observed and that no effect on response time would be seen in a placebo arm. objectives: we tested the hypothesis that subjects homozygous for the long allele at the 5httlpr polymorphism would respond more rapidly to sertraline than subjects carrying one or two copies of the short allele. methods: ham-d and cgi-i responses to sertraline and placebo were measured weekly in the context of an 8-week, placebo-controlled study in elderly depressed subjects. genotyping of the 5httlpr polymorphism was performed to test for correlations with response at each week in the sertraline and placebo groups ( n=206). results: subjects homozygous for the long allele of 5httlpr showed a significant increase in response at week 1 and week 2, as assessed by the cgi-i scale compared with subjects carrying one or two copies of the short allele ( p=0.01 at both weeks). no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. conclusions: these results suggest that genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene effects the response time to sertraline and provides complementing evidence to previous reports that this polymorphism affects response time to other ssris.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ effect of developmental dioxin exposure on methylation and expression of specific imprinted genes in mice. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) is an endocrine disruptor affecting the reproductive system in humans. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tcdd administered to pregnant mice at two different doses (2-10 ng/kg/day), on imprinted genes in the male offspring. the degree of methylation and the mrna expression of snrpn, peg3 and igf2r were analyzed in the sperm, skeletal muscle and liver. tcdd administration (10 ng/kg/day) decreased the sperm count in the male offspring. it did not affect methylation but increased mrna expression of snrpn, peg3, igf2r and air ncrna. in muscle and liver, tcdd (10 ng/kg/day) induced increases in methylation and decreases in mrna expression of igf2r. these results show that the robust effects of tcdd on the mrna expression of snrpn, peg3 and igf2r genes in the sperm and of igf2r in the muscle and liver are unrelated to changes in methylation in their respective genes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ evidence for a new binding mode to gsk-3: allosteric regulation by the marine compound palinurin. glycogen synthase kinase 3β (gsk-3β) is widely recognised as a relevant player in the pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders such as alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, diabetes and cancer. therefore, this enzyme constitutes a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. we describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine natural sesquiterpene palinurin as a gsk-3β inhibitor. experimental studies performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that gsk-3β inhibition by palinurin cannot be competed out by atp nor peptide substrate. molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional binding mode to gsk-3β. moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to gsk-3β inhibition. the inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related analogues support the proposed binding mode of palinurin, which is the first compound described to target this allosteric site. the results offer new opportunities for designing and developing selective inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ differential responses to ω-agatoxin iva in murine frontal cortex and spinal cord derived neuronal networks. ω-agatoxin-iva is a well known p/q-type ca(2+) channel blocker and has been shown to affect presynaptic ca(2+) currents as well postsynaptic potentials. p/q-type voltage gated ca(2+) channels play a vital role in presynaptic neurotransmitter release and thus play a role in action potential generation. monitoring spontaneous activity of neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays (meas) provides an important tool for examining this neurotoxin. changes in extracellular action potentials are readily observed and are dependent on synaptic function. given the efficacy of murine frontal cortex and spinal cord networks to detect neuroactive substances, we investigated the effects of ω-agatoxin on spontaneous action potential firing within these networks. we found that networks derived from spinal cord are more sensitive to the toxin than those from frontal cortex; a concentration of only 10nm produced statistically significant effects on activity from spinal cord networks whereas 50nm was required to alter activity in frontal cortex networks. furthermore, the effects of the toxin on frontal cortex are more complex as unit specific responses were observed. these manifested as either a decrease or increase in action potential firing rate which could be statistically separated as unique clusters. administration of bicuculline, a gabaa inhibitor, isolated a single response to ω-agatoxin, which was characterized by a reduction in network activity. these data support the notion that the two clusters detected with ω-agatoxin exposure represent differential responses from excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ copper induced upregulation of apoptosis related genes in zebrafish (danio rerio) gill. copper (cu) is an essential micronutrient that, when present in high concentrations, becomes toxic to aquatic organisms. it is known that cu toxicity may induce apoptotic cell death. however, the precise mechanism and the pathways that are activated, in fish, are still unclear. thus, this study aimed to assess which apoptotic pathways are triggered by cu, in zebrafish (danio rerio) gill, the main target of waterborne pollutants. fish where exposed to 12.5 and 100 μg/l of cu during 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. fish gills were collected to tunel assay and mrna expression analysis of selected genes by real time pcr. an approach to different apoptosis pathways was done selecting p53, caspase-8, caspase-9 and apoptosis inducing factor (aif) genes. the higher incidence of tunel-positive cells, in gill epithelia of the exposed fish, proved that cu induced apoptosis. the results suggest that different apoptosis pathways are triggered by cu at different time points of the exposure period, as the increase in transcripts was sequential, instead of simultaneous. apoptosis seems to be initiated via intrinsic pathway (caspase-9), through p53 activation; then followed by the extrinsic pathway (caspase-8) and finally by the caspase-independent pathway (aif). a possible model for cu-induce apoptosis pathways is proposed.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ibandronate increases the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene fas by epigenetic mechanisms in tumor cells. there is growing evidence that aminobisphosphonates like ibandronate show anticancer activity by an unknown mechanism. biochemically, they prevent posttranslational isoprenylation of small gtpases, thus inhibiting their activity. in tumor cells, activated ras-gtpase, the founding member of the gene family, down-regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene fas via epigenetic dna-methylation by dnmt1. we compared ibandronate treatment in neoplastic human u-2 osteosarcoma and in mouse ccl-51 breast cancer cells as well as in the immortalized non-neoplastic mc3t3-e1 osteoblastic cells. ibandronate attenuated cell proliferation in all cell lines tested. in the neoplastic cells we found up-regulation of caspases suggesting apoptosis. further we found stimulation of fas-expression as a result of epigenetic dna demethylation that was due to down-regulation of dnmt1, which was rescued by re-isoprenylation by both geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and farnesylpyrophosphate. in contrast, ibandronate did not affect fas and dnmt1 expression in mc3t3-e1 non-neoplastic cells. data suggest that bisphosphonates via modulation of the activity of small-gtpases induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells by dna-cpg-demethylation and stimulation of fas-expression. in conclusion the shown epigenetic mechanism underlying the anti-neoplastic activity of farnesyl-transferase-inhibition, also explains the clinical success of other drugs, which target this pathway.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the potassium channel subunit kvbeta3 interacts with pannexin 1 and attenuates its sensitivity to changes in redox potentials. pannexin 1 (panx1), a member of the second gap junction protein family identified in vertebrates, appears to preferentially form non-junctional membrane channels. a candidate regulatory protein of panx1 is the potassium channel subunit kvbeta3, previously identified by bacterial two-hybrid strategies. here, we report on the physical association of panx1 with kvbeta3 by immunoprecipitation when co-expressed in a neuroblastoma cell line (neuro2a). furthermore, in vivo co-expression of panx1 and kvbeta3 was shown to occur in murine hippocampus and cerebellum. kvbeta3 is known to accelerate inactivation of otherwise slowly inactivating potassium channels under reducing conditions. we subsequently found that panx1 channel currents exhibit a significant reduction when exposed to reducing agents, and that this effect is attenuated in the presence of kvbeta3. apparently, kvbeta3 is involved in regulating the susceptibility of panx1 channels to redox potential. furthermore, the panx1 channel blockers carbenoxolone and probenecid were less effective in inhibiting panx1 currents when kvbeta3 was co-expressed. the influence of kvbeta3 on panx1 is the first example of modulation of panx1 channel function(s) by interacting proteins, and suggests the physiological importance of sensing changes in redox potentials.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ dimerized glycosaminoglycan chains increase fgf signaling during zebrafish development. proteoglycans (pgs) modulate numerous signaling pathways during development through binding of their glycosaminoglycan (gag) side chains to various signaling molecules, including fibroblast growth factors (fgfs). a majority of pgs possess two or more gag side chains, suggesting that gag multivalency is imperative for biological functions in vivo. however, only a few studies have examined the biological significance of gag multivalency. in this report, we utilized a library of bis- and tris-xylosides that produce two and three gag chains on the same scaffold, respectively, thus mimicking pgs, to examine the importance of gag valency and chain type in regulating fgf/fgfr interactions in vivo in zebrafish. a number of bis- and tris-xylosides, but not mono-xylosides, caused an elongation phenotype upon their injection into embryos. in situ hybridization showed that elongated embryos have elevated expression of the fgf target gene mkp3 but unchanged expression of reporters for other pathways, indicating that fgf/fgfr signaling was specifically hyperactivated. in support of this observation, elongation can be reversed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor su5402, mrna for the fgfr antagonist sprouty4, or fgf8 morpholino. endogenous gags seem to be unaffected after xyloside treatment, suggesting that this is a gain-of-function phenotype. furthermore, expression of a multivalent but not a monovalent gag containing syndecan-1 proteoglycan recapitulates the elongation phenotype observed with the bivalent xylosides. on the basis of these in vivo findings, we propose a new model for gag/fgf/fgfr interactions in which dimerized gag chains can activate fgf-mediated signal transduction pathways.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ pharmacological characterization of glucocorticoid receptors in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. bronchial epithelial cells play an important role in amplifying and perpetuating airway inflammation and may be a target for inhaled steroids. we have characterized glucocorticoid receptors in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. northern and western blot analyses demonstrated the expression of glucocorticoid receptor mrna and protein, respectively, in primary bronchial epithelial cells. the activity of these receptors was shown using a radioligand binding assay. high-affinity binding with pharmacological specificity was demonstrated for [3h]dexamethasone. the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and density of binding sites (bmax) for [3h]dexamethasone determined from saturation isotherms were 4.4 nm x/divided by 0.95 (sem) and 30.1 fmol/mg protein +/-6.4 (sem). glucocorticoid receptors were activated by dexamethasone as assessed using a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter plasmid, ptat3-cat. transfection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells with this reporter plasmid resulted in 35-fold activation of transcription following dexamethasone stimulation (10(-6) m). the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist ru-486 (mifepristone) significantly counteracted the effect of dexamethasone on glucocorticoid receptor activation, indicating that the dexamethasone effect is specific and is mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor. in summary, our study demonstrated that primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells possess glucocorticoid receptors that function as a ligand-activated transcriptional regulator. the presence of glucocorticoid receptors confers their responsiveness to glucocorticoids and indicates that the airway epithelium may be a target for the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled steroids.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cholinesterase inhibitors for alzheimer's disease. background: since the introduction of the first cholinesterase inhibitor (chei) in 1997, most clinicians and probably most patients would consider the cholinergic drugs, donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate alzheimer's disease.the drugs have slightly different pharmacological properties, but they all work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter associated with memory, by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. the most that these drugs could achieve is to modify the manifestations of alzheimer's disease. cochrane reviews of each chei for alzheimer's disease have been completed (birks 2005, birks 2005b and loy 2005). despite the evidence from the clinical studies and the intervening clinical experience the debate on whether cheis are effective continues. objectives: to assess the effects of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to alzheimer's disease. search strategy: the cochrane dementia and cognitive improvement group's specialized register was searched using the terms 'donepezil', 'e2020' , 'aricept' , galanthamin* galantamin* reminyl, rivastigmine, exelon, "ena 713" and ena-713 on 12 june 2005. this register contains up-to-date records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases. selection criteria: all unconfounded, blinded, randomized trials in which treatment with a chei was compared with placebo or another chei for patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to alzheimer's disease. data collection and analysis: data were extracted by one reviewer (jsb), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled treatment effects, or the risks and benefits of treatment estimated. main results: the results of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrate that treatment for periods of 6 months and one year, with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine at the recommended dose for people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to alzheimer's disease produced improvements in cognitive function, on average -2.7 points (95%ci -3.0 to -2.3), in the midrange of the 70 point adas-cog scale. study clinicians blind to other measures rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients. benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour. none of these treatment effects are large. there is nothing to suggest the effects are less for patients with severe dementia or mild dementia, although there is very little evidence for other than mild to moderate dementia.more patients leave chei treatment groups, approximately 29 %, on account of adverse events than leave the placebo groups (18%). there is evidence of more adverse events in total in the patients treated with a chei than with placebo. although many types of adverse event were reported, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, were significantly more frequent in the chei groups than in placebo. there are four studies, all supported by one of the pharmaceutical companies, in which two cheis were compared, two studies of donepezil compared with galantamine, and two of donepezil compared with rivastigmine. in three studies the patients were not blinded to treatment, only the fourth, don vs riv/bullock is double blind. two of the studies provide little evidence, they are of 12 weeks duration, which is barely long enough to complete the drug titration. there is no evidence from don vs gal/wilcock of a treatment difference between donepezil and galantamine at 52 weeks for cognition, activities of daily living, the numbers who leave the trial before the end of treatment, the number who suffer any adverse event, or any specific adverse event. there is no evidence from don vs riv/bullock of a difference between donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive function, activities of daily living and behavioural disturbance at two years. fewer patients suffer adverse events on donepezil than rivastigmine. authors' conclusions: the three cholinesterase inhibitors are efficacious for mild to moderate alzheimer's disease. it is not possible to identify those who will respond to treatment prior to treatment. there is no evidence that treatment with a chei is not cost effective. despite the slight variations in the mode of action of the three cholinesterase inhibitors there is no evidence of any differences between them with respect to efficacy. there appears to be less adverse effects associated with donepezil compared with rivastigmine. it may be that galantamine and rivastigmine match donepezil in tolerability if a

(euphorpiaceae), isolate and identify the active compounds that could be responsible for the activity, in addition to determination of the possible mechanism of action. six compounds were isolated and identified from this plant: three phenolic compounds (kampferol, kampferol-3-glucoside and kampferol-3-galactoside) in addition to three steroidal compounds (1-ethoxypentacosane, heptacosan-1-ol and β-sitosterol). three compounds (heptacosan-1-ol, β-sitosterol and kampferol-3-galactoside) were found to be responsible for the anti-uc activity of e. granuleta extract. the anti-uc activity of these compounds may be explained by reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α), in addition to reduction of colonic malondialdehyde (mda) contents. no side effects were reported on liver and kidney functions. the active compounds reduced both serum tnf-α and mucosal mda levels. copyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ investigating the regulation of one-carbon metabolism in arabidopsis thaliana. serine (ser) biosynthesis in c(3) plants can occur via several pathways. one major route involves the tetrahydrofolate (thf)-dependent activities of the glycine decarboxylase complex (gdc, ec 2.1.1.10) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt, ec 2.1.2.1) with glycine (gly) as one-carbon (1-c) source. an alternative thf-dependent pathway involves the c1-thf synthase/shmt activities with formate as 1-c source. here, we have investigated aspects of the regulation of these two folate-mediated pathways in arabidopsis thaliana (l.) heynh. columbia using two approaches. firstly, transgenic plants overexpressing formate dehydrogenase (fdh, ec 1.2.1.2) were used to continue our previous studies on the function of fdh in formate metabolism. the formate pool size was approximately 73 nmol (g fw)(-1) in wild type (wt) arabidopsis plants; three independent transgenic lines had similar-sized pools of formate. transgenic plants produced more (13)co(2) from supplied [(13)c]formate than did wt plants but were not significantly different from wt plants in their synthesis of ser. we concluded that fdh has no direct role in the regulation of the above two pathways of ser synthesis; the breakdown of formate to co(2) by the fdh reaction is the primary and preferred fate of the organic acid in arabidopsis. the ratio between the gdc/shmt and c1-thf synthase/shmt pathways of ser synthesis from [alpha-(13)c]gly and [(13)c]formate, respectively, in arabidopsis shoots was 21 : 1; in roots, 9 : 1. in shoots, therefore, the pathway from formate plays only a small role in ser synthesis; in the case of roots, results indicated that the 9 : 1 ratio was as a result of greater fluxes of (13)c through both pathways together with a relatively higher contribution from the c1-thf synthase/shmt route than in shoots. we also examined the synthesis of ser in a gdc-deficient mutant of arabidopsis (glyd) where the gdc/shmt pathway was impaired. compared with wt, glyd plants accumulated 5-fold more gly than wt after supplying [alpha-(13)c]gly for 24 h; the accumulation of ser from [alpha-(13)c]gly was reduced by 25% in the same time period. on the other hand, the accumulation of ser through the c1-thf synthase/shmt pathway in glyd plants was 2.5-fold greater than that in wt plants. our experiments confirmed that the gdc/shmt and c1-thf synthase/shmt pathways normally operate independently in arabidopsis plants but that when the primary gdc/shmt pathway is impaired the alternative c1-thf synthase/shmt pathway can partially compensate for deficiencies in the synthesis of ser.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ chemoprevention for high-risk women: tamoxifen and beyond. the demonstration by the national surgical adjuvant breast project (nsabp) that 5 years of tamoxifen therapy is associated with an approximate 50% reduction in breast cancer incidence in high-risk women was a milestone in breast cancer prevention. because tamoxifen is associated with increased risk of side-effects such as hot flashes, menstrual abnormalities, uterine cancer, and thromboembolic phenomena, its use will not be advisable or acceptable for all high-risk women. women over 50 years of age appear to be at highest risk for serious adverse events, such as uterine cancer and thromboembolic phenomena. individuals in whom tamoxifen-associated breast cancer risk reduction appears to outweigh risk of serious side-effects include women with prior in situ or estrogen receptor (er)-positive invasive cancer, atypical hyperplasia, and/or women ages 35-49 with a calculated gail 5-year risk of > or =1.7%, hysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year gail risk of > or =2.5%, and nonhysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year gail risk of >5.0%. it is not yet clear whether tamoxifen can reduce breast cancer incidence in women with brca1 and brca2 mutations, although preliminary evidence favors benefit for at least those with a brca2 mutation. raloxifene is a selective er modulator with less uterine estrogen agonist activity than tamoxifen, and it is hoped that it will result in fewer uterine cancers but will be equally efficacious in reducing the risk of breast cancer. the nsabp is currently conducting a randomized study of tamoxifen versus raloxifene in high-risk postmenopausal women. approximately one third of invasive cancers are er negative. tamoxifen does not reduce the incidence of er-negative cancers, nor does it appear to be effective in preventing the appearance of one third of er-positive cancers. priorities in prevention research are to develop (a) biomarkers to refine short-term risk assessments based on epidemiologic models, (b) biomarkers predictive of response to specific classes of preventive agents, (c) drugs with fewer side-effects and/or effective in er-negative or er-positive tamoxifen-resistant precancerous disease, and (d) efficient clinical trial models to assess new agent efficacy. breast intraepithelial neoplasia (ien) may be sampled by minimally invasive techniques and is an attractive short-term risk biomarker. molecular abnormalities observed in ien may be used to select potential agents for testing/therapy, and modulation of these abnormalities may be used in phase i trials to select appropriate doses and in phase ii trials to assess response. breast density volume and certain serum markers such as insulin-like growth factor-1 are also being studied as potential risk and response biomarkers. reversal or prevention of advanced ien as well as modulation of other risk biomarkers in randomized phase ii and phase iii trials is being evaluated as a means of more efficiently evaluating prevention drugs in the future. a number of agents are being developed that target molecular abnormalities in ien, have fewer or different side effects than tamoxifen, and may be effective in er-negative or tamoxifen-resistant disease.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ cucurbitacin i inhibits rac1 activation in breast cancer cells by a reactive oxygen species-mediated mechanism and independently of janus tyrosine kinase 2 and p-rex1. the small gtpase rac1 has been widely implicated in mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. previous studies established that stimulation of erbb receptors in breast cancer cells activates rac1 and enhances motility via the rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor p-rex1. as the janus tyrosine kinase 2 (jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with erbb receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate p-rex1/rac1 activation in response to erbb ligands. here we found that the anticancer agent cucurbitacin i, a jak2 inhibitor, reduced the activation of rac1 and motility in response to the erbb3 ligand heregulin in breast cancer cells. however, rac1 activation was not affected by jak2 or stat3 rna interference, suggesting that the effect of cucurbitacin i occurs through a jak2-independent mechanism. cucurbitacin i also failed to affect the activation of p-rex1 by heregulin. subsequent analysis revealed that cucurbitacin i strongly activates rhoa and the rho effector rho kinase (rock) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. interestingly, disruption of the rhoa-rock pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin i on rac1 activation by heregulin. lastly, we found that rhoa activation by cucurbitacin i is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ros). the ros scavenger n-acetyl l-cysteine and the mitochondrial antioxidant mito-tempo rescued the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin i on rac1 activation. in conclusion, these results indicate that erbb-driven rac1 activation in breast cancer cells proceeds independently of the jak2 pathway. moreover, they established that the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin i on rac1 activity involves the alteration of the balance between rho and rac.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ inborn errors in the metabolism of glutathione. glutathione is a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine and glycine. glutathione is present in millimolar concentrations in most mammalian cells and it is involved in several fundamental biological functions, including free radical scavenging, detoxification of xenobiotics and carcinogens, redox reactions, biosynthesis of dna, proteins and leukotrienes, as well as neurotransmission/neuromodulation. glutathione is metabolised via the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which is catalyzed by six enzymes. in man, hereditary deficiencies have been found in five of the six enzymes. glutathione synthetase deficiency is the most frequently recognized disorder and, in its severe form, it is associated with hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, 5-oxoprolinuria, central nervous system (cns) damage and recurrent bacterial infections. gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency is also associated with hemolytic anemia, and some patients with this disorder show defects of neuromuscular function and generalized aminoaciduria. gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency has been found in patients with cns involvement and glutathionuria. 5-oxoprolinase deficiency is associated with 5-oxoprolinuria but without a clear association with other symptoms. dipeptidase deficiency has been described in one patient. all disorders are very rare and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. most of the mutations are leaky so that many patients have residual enzyme activity. diagnosis is made by measuring the concentration of different metabolites in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, enzyme activity and in glutathione synthetase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency, also by mutation analysis. prenatal diagnosis has been preformed in glutathione synthetase deficiency. the prognosis is difficult to predict, as few patients are known, but seems to vary significantly between different patients. the aims of the treatment of glutathione synthesis defects are to avoid hemolytic crises and to increase the defense against reactive oxygen species. no treatment has been recommended for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, 5-oxoprolinase and dipeptidase deficiency.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ concurrent regulation of the transcription factors nrf2 and atf4 mediates the enhancement of glutathione levels by the flavonoid fisetin. glutathione (gsh) and gsh-associated metabolism provide the major line of defense for the protection of cells from various forms of toxic stress. gsh also plays a key role in regulating the intracellular redox environment. thus, maintenance of gsh levels is developing into an important therapeutic objective for the treatment of a variety of diseases. among the transcription factors that play critical roles in gsh metabolism are nf-e2-related factor 2 (nrf2) and activating transcription factor 4 (atf4). thus, compounds that can upregulate these transcription factors may be particularly useful as treatment options through their effects on gsh metabolism. we previously showed that the flavonoid fisetin not only increases basal levels of gsh but also maintains gsh levels under oxidative stress conditions. however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have remained unknown until now. here we show that fisetin rapidly increases the levels of both nrf2 and atf4 as well as nrf2- and atf4-dependent gene transcription via distinct mechanisms. although fisetin greatly increases the stability of both nrf2 and atf4, only the effect on atf4 is dependent on protein kinase activity. using sirna we found that atf4, but not nrf2, is important for fisetin's ability to increase gsh levels under basal conditions whereas both atf4 and nrf2 appear to cooperate to increase gsh levels under oxidative stress conditions. based upon these results, we hypothesize that compounds able to increase gsh levels via multiple mechanisms, such as fisetin, will be particularly effective for maintaining gsh levels under a variety of different stresses.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ secretion of l-glutamate from osteoclasts through transcytosis. osteoclasts are involved in the catabolism of the bone matrix and eliminate the resulting degradation products through transcytosis, but the molecular mechanism and regulation of transcytosis remain poorly understood. upon differentiation, osteoclasts express vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vglut1), which is essential for vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of glutamate in neurons. vglut1 is localized in transcytotic vesicles and accumulates l-glutamate. osteoclasts secrete l-glutamate and the bone degradation products upon stimulation with kcl or atp in a ca2+-dependent manner. kcl- and atp-dependent secretion of l-glutamate was absent in osteoclasts prepared from vglut1-/- knockout mice. osteoclasts express mglur8, a class iii metabotropic glutamate receptor. its stimulation by a specific agonist inhibits secretion of l-glutamate and bone degradation products, whereas its suppression by a specific antagonist stimulates bone resorption. finally, it was found that vglut1-/- mice develop osteoporosis. thus, in bone-resorbing osteoclasts, l-glutamate and bone degradation products are secreted through transcytosis and the released l-glutamate is involved in autoregulation of transcytosis. glutamate signaling may play an important role in the bone homeostasis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ differential binding of fibroblast growth factor-2 and -7 to basement membrane heparan sulfate: comparison of normal and abnormal human tissues. fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) play multiple roles during development and in adult tissues as paracrine regulators of growth and differentiation. fgfs signal through transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, but heparan sulfate is also required for signaling by members of the fgf family. in addition, heparan sulfate may be involved in determining tissue distribution of fgfs. using biotinylated fgf-2 and fgf-7 (kgf) as probes, we have identified specific interactions between fgfs and heparan sulfates in human tissues. both fgf species bind to tissue mast cells and to epithelial cell membranes. binding to basement membrane heparan sulfate is tissue source dependent and specific. although fgf-2 strongly binds to basement membrane heparan sulfate in skin and most other tissue sites examined, fgf-7 fails to bind to basement membrane heparan sulfate in most locations. however, in subendothelial matrix in blood vessels and in the basement membrane of a papillary renal cell carcinoma, strong fgf-7 binding is seen. in summary, distinct and specific affinities of heparan sulfates for different fgfs were identified that may affect growth factor activation and local distribution. heparan sulfate may have a gatekeeper function to either restrict or permit diffusion of heparin-binding growth factors across the basement membrane.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ nanoparticle toxicity in daphnia magna reproduction studies: the importance of test design. the increasing use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (ntio(2)) inevitably results in their release into the environment, raising concerns about potential adverse effects in wildlife. by following standard test protocols, several studies investigated the ecotoxicity of ntio(2) among others to daphnia magna. these studies indicated a large variability - several orders of magnitude - in the response variables. however, other factors, like nanoparticle characteristics and test design, potentially triggering these differences, were largely ignored. therefore, the present study assessed the chronic ecotoxicity of two ntio(2) products with varying crystalline structure (a-100; p25) to d. magna. a semi-static and a flow-through exposure scenario were compared, ensuring that both contained environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. utilizing the semi-static test design, a concentration as low as 0.06 mg/l a-100 (∼330 nm) significantly reduced the reproduction of daphnia indicating environmental risk. in contrast, no implication in the number of released offspring was observed during the flow-through experiment with a-100 (∼140 nm). likewise, p25 (∼130 nm) did not adversely affect reproduction irrespective of the test design utilized. given the present study's results, the particle size, the product composition, i.e. the crystalline structure, and the accumulation of ntio(2) at the bottom of the test vessel - the latter is relevant for a semi-static test design - may be suggested as factors potentially triggering differences in ntio(2) toxicity to d. magna. hence, these factors should be considered to improve environmental risk assessment of nanoparticles.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ alpha1-adrenoceptors are required for normal male sexual function. background and purpose: alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists are extensively used in the treatment of hypertension and lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. among the side effects, ejaculatory dysfunction occurs more frequently with drugs that are relatively selective for alpha(1a)-adrenoceptors compared with other drugs of this class. this suggests that alpha(1a)-adrenoceptors may contribute to ejaculation. however, this has not been studied at the molecular level. experimental approach: the physiological contribution of each alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype was characterized using alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype-selective knockout (ko) mice (alpha(1a)-, alpha(1b)- and alpha(1d)-ar ko mice) since the subtype-specific drugs available are only moderately selective. we analysed the role of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the blood pressure and vascular response as well as ejaculation by determining these variables in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype-selective ko mice and in mice with all their alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes deleted (alpha(1)-ar triple-ko mice). key results: the pregnancy rate was reduced by 50% in alpha(1a)-adrenoceptor ko mice, and this reduction was dramatically enhanced in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor triple-ko mice. contractile tension of the vas deferens in response to noradrenaline was markedly decreased in alpha(1a)-adrenoceptor ko mice, and this contraction was completely abolished in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor triple-ko mice. this attenuation of contractility was also observed in the electrically stimulated vas deferens. conclusions and implications: these results demonstrate that alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, particularly alpha(1a)-adrenoceptors, are required for normal contractility of the vas deferens and consequent sperm ejaculation as well as having a function in fertility.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ phenserine. phenserine, a derivative of physostigmine, was first described as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (ache) and was shown to improve cognition in various experimental paradigms in rodents and dogs. it was clinically tested for alzheimer's disease, with moderate success in initial phase ii studies. phenserine deserves attention for an additional quality of action: in addition to inhibiting ache, it modulates the amount of beta-amyloid precursor protein (app) in neuronal cell culture by reducing app translation. this effect probably involves interaction of phenserine with a regulatory element in the 5'-untranslated region of the app gene that controls app expression. phenserine apparently reduces translational efficiency of app mrna into protein, a process that may involve an interaction with iron and/or an iron-responsive element. as a consequence, phenserine reduces beta-amyloid peptide (abeta) formation in vitro and in vivo. phenserine is also unique because of differing actions of its enantiomers: (-)-phenserine is the active enantiomer for inhibition of ache, whereas (+)-phenserine ('posiphen') has weak activity as an ache inhibitor and can be dosed much higher. both enantiomers are equipotent in downregulating app expression. (+)-posiphen may be a promising drug, either alone or in combination with (-)-phenserine, to attenuate the progression of alzheimer's disease.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ protective effect of halothane anesthesia on retinal light damage: inhibition of metabolic rhodopsin regeneration. purpose: to determine whether the volatile anesthetic halothane protects against light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in the rodent retina. methods: albino mice and rats were anesthetized with halothane and exposed to high levels of white or blue light. nonanesthetized animals served as controls. retinal morphology was assessed by light microscopy, and apoptosis of photoreceptor cells was verified by detection of fragmented genomic dna and in situ staining of apoptotic nuclei (tunel assay). rhodopsin regeneration after bleaching was determined by measuring rhodopsin levels in retinas of mice or rats at different time points in darkness. results: halothane anesthesia reversibly inhibited metabolic rhodopsin regeneration and thus prevented rhodopsin from absorbing high numbers of photons during light exposure. consequently, photoreceptors of mice and rats anesthetized with halothane were completely protected against degeneration induced by white light. in remarkable contrast, however, halothane anesthesia did not protect against blue-light-induced photoreceptor cell death. conclusions: after the initial bleach, halothane impeded photon absorption by rhodopsin by inhibiting metabolic rhodopsin regeneration. apparently, the rhodopsin-mediated uptake of the critical number of photons to initiate white light-induced retinal degeneration was prevented. in contrast, halothane did not protect the retina against blue light. blue light can efficiently restore functional rhodopsin from bleaching intermediates through a process termed photoreversal of bleaching. this process does not depend on the visual cycle via the pigment epithelium but nevertheless enables rhodopsin molecules to absorb the critical number of photons required to induce retinal degeneration.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ central 5-ht3 receptor stimulation by m-cpbg increases blood glucose in rats. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of central 5-ht3 receptors on the control of blood glucose in stressed and non-stressed rats in both fasted and fed states. adult wistar male rats had each their third ventricle cannulated 7 days before the experiments. injections of m-cpbg, a selective 5-ht3 receptor agonist, induced a significant increase in blood glucose in non-stressed rats in both fasted and in fed states. the same procedure was unable to modify stress-induced hyperglycemia. the hyperglycemic effect of m-cpbg central administration was blocked by pretreatment with ondansetron, a specific 5-ht3 receptor antagonist, indicating that the effects here obtained with m-cpbg were a result of its interaction with 5-ht3 receptors. third ventricle injections of ondansetron alone were not able to modify blood glucose in non-stressed animals and did not change the hyperglycemic responses observed after immobilization stress. we conclude that pharmacological activation of the central 5-ht3 receptor induces a hyperglycemic effect in non-stressed animals.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ metformin and sulfonylureas in relation to cancer risk in type ii diabetes patients: a meta-analysis using primary data of published studies. introduction: accumulating evidence suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and hyperinsulinemia are at increased risk for developing malignancies. it remains to be fully elucidated whether use of metformin, an insulin sensitizer, and/or sulfonylureas, insulin secretagogues, affect cancer incidence in subjects with t2dm. material & methods: we performed a meta-analysis using pubmed, of randomized control trials (rcts), cohorts, and case-control studies published through july 2012 that assess effects of metformin and/or sulfonylurea sulfonylureas on cancer risk at any site, in subjects with t2dm. fixed and random effects meta-analysis models were used, and the effect size was summarized as relative risk (rr) for rcts/cohorts and as odds ratio (or) for the case-control studies. results: analysis of 24 metformin studies in subjects with t2dm showed that metformin use is associated with reduced risk for the development of cancer, in both cohort (rr=0.70 [95% ci=0.67-0.73]) and case-control studies (or=0.90 [95% ci=0.84-0.98]), but this finding was not supported by rcts (rr=1.01[95% ci=0.81-1.26]). data from 18 sulfonylurea studies in subjects with t2dm showed that sulfonylurea use is associated with an increase in all-cancer risk, in cohort studies (rr=1.55 [95% ci=1.48 -1.63]), though data from rcts (rr=1.17 [95% ci=0.95-1.45]) and case-control studies (or=1.02 [95% ci=0.93-1.13]) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect. conclusions: this analysis using pooled primary data demonstrates that metformin use reduces, while sulfonylurea use may be associated with an increased cancer risk in subjects with t2dm. these findings need to be confirmed in large-scale rcts before they are translated into clinical practice.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ inhibitory effects of a bazedoxifene/conjugated equine estrogen combination on human breast cancer cells in vitro. breast cancer incidence is increased in women receiving menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin but not with estrogen alone. the use of a tissue-selective estrogen complex (tsec) has been proposed as a novel menopausal hormone therapy strategy to eliminate the requirement for a progestogen. combination of bazedoxifene (bza) with conjugated estrogens (ces), the first tsec, has shown beneficial effects. whether it would exert antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer is not clear. to address this issue, we compared estradiol (e(2)) and ce alone on proliferation and apoptosis in mcf-7 breast cancer cells. ce stimulated growth of mcf-7 cells at a peak concentration 10-fold higher than required for e(2). both ce and e(2) alone increased dna synthesis and reduced apoptosis with activation of mapk, akt, and p70s6k and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors survivin, bcl-2, and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, these effects could be completely blocked by bza. gene expression studies demonstrated that ce and e(2) were equally potent on expression of cmyc, ps2, and wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2, whereas the stimulatory effects of ce on progesterone receptor and amphiregulin expression were weaker than e(2). bza effectively blocked each of these effects and showed no estrogen agonistic effects when used alone. our results indicate that the stimulatory effects of e(2) or ce on breast cancer cells could be completely abrogated by bza. these studies imply that the ce/bza, tsec, exerts antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer cells and might block the growth of occult breast neoplasms in postmenopausal women, resulting in an overall reduction in tumor incidence.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ adverse outcome pathways during zebrafish embryogenesis: a case study with paraoxon. using paraoxon as a reference acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitor, the objective of this study was to develop an adverse outcome pathway (aop) that provided quantitative linkages across levels of biological organization during zebrafish embryogenesis. within normal zebrafish embryos, we first demonstrated that ache transcripts and ache activity increased in a stage-dependent manner following segmentation. we then showed that static exposure of embryos to paraoxon (31.2-500 nm) from 5 to 96 hpf resulted in significant stage- and concentration-dependent ache inhibition, albeit these effects were fully reversible within 48 h following transfer to clean water. however, even in the presence of significant ache inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic paraoxon concentrations (≤250 nm) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron development at 96 hpf. therefore, we investigated the potential effects of paraoxon exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - an early locomotor behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. based on these studies, the frequency of spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - a developmental stage with minimal ache expression and activity - was significantly higher following exposure to paraoxon concentrations as low as 31.2 nm. overall, our data suggest that (1) normal ache activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf are sensitive to paraoxon exposure, an effect that may be independent of ache inhibition. using a well-studied reference chemical, this study highlights the potential challenges in developing quantitative aops to support chemical screening and prioritization strategies.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ dna methylation and histone modification profiles of mouse organic anion transporting polypeptides. organic anion transporting polypeptides (rodents, oatps; human, oatps) are primarily involved in the transmembrane transportation of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds. multiple mouse oatp1 isoforms are closely located on chromosome 6, where each isoform shows distinct tissue distribution; oatp1b2, oatp1a6, and oatp1c1 are expressed exclusively in the liver, kidney, and cerebrum, respectively; oatp1a1 in the liver and kidney; and oatp1a4 in the liver and cerebrum. we have identified tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (t-dmr) around the transcriptional start site (tss) of oatp1b2, which correlates with its liver-specific expression. bisulfite sequencing also demonstrated the presence of t-dmrs around the tss in other oatp1 genes: cpg dinucleotides at +149 relative to the tss for oatp1c1; -48, +101, and +356 for oatp1a4; -572 and -550 for oatp1a1; and -122 and +216 for oatp1a6 were differentially methylated among the liver, kidney, and cerebrum. these methylation profiles were largely consistent with the tissue distribution of oatp1 mrnas. chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the mrna expression of oatp1 genes was accompanied by acetylated histone h3. human oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 are located on chromosome 12p12 in the oatp1 cluster; both show predominant expression in the liver. these genes also contained t-dmrs that were hypomethylated in the liver, compared with kidney cortex: -511, -411, and +92 relative to the tss for oatp1b1 and -331, +70, and +73 for oatp1b3. these results suggest that the difference in epigenetic profiles comprising dna methylation and histone acetylation determines the distinct tissue distribution of oatp/oatp mrnas.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ pxr antagonists and implication in drug metabolism. adopted orphan nuclear receptor (nr), pregnane x receptor (pxr), plays a central role in the regulation of xeno- and endobiotic metabolism. since the discovery of the functional role of pxr in 1998, there is evolving evidence for the role of pxr agonists in abrogating metabolic pathophysiology (e.g., cholestasis, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation). however, more recently, it is clear that pxr is also an important mediator of adverse xeno- (e.g., enhances acetaminophen toxicity) and endobiotic (e.g., hepatic steatosis) metabolic phenotypes. moreover, in cancer therapeutics, pxr activation can induce drug resistance, and there is growing evidence for tissue-specific enhancement of the malignant phenotype. thus, in these instances, there may be a role for pxr antagonists. however, as opposed to the discovery efforts for pxr agonists, there are only a few antagonists described. the mode of action of these antagonists (e.g., sulforaphane) remains less clear. our laboratory efforts have focused on this question. since the original discovery of azoles analogs as pxr antagonists, we have preliminarily defined an important pxr antagonist pharmacophore and developed less-toxic pxr antagonists. in this review, we describe our published and unpublished findings on recent structure-function studies involving the azole chemical scaffold. further work in the future is needed to fully define potent, more-selective pxr antagonists that may be useful in clinical application.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ disodium cromoglycate does not prevent terbutaline-induced desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular in vivo functions in human volunteers. in humans, prolonged administration of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline leads to a desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular responses, which can be blunted by concomitant administration of the antianaphylactic drug ketotifen. this study investigated the effect of disodium cromoglycate, another antiallergic drug, on terbutaline-induced desensitization of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular and noncardiovascular responses. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design, nine healthy male volunteers received disodium cromoglycate (4 x 200 mg/day, p.o.) or placebo for 3 weeks with terbutaline (3 x 5 mg/day, p.o.) administered concomitantly during the last 2 weeks. beta 2-adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by the increase in heart rate and reduction of diastolic blood pressure induced by an incremental intravenous infusion of the unselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline; beta 1-adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by exercise-induced tachycardia. tremulousness was monitored as a beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated noncardiovascular effect. after 2 weeks' administration of terbutaline, there was a marked and significant (p < 0.001) attenuation of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia (mean percentage attenuation, 53.3%) and of the isoprenaline-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure (mean percentage attenuation, 55.6%). exercise-induced tachycardia also was significantly (p < 0.001) blunted, but the magnitude of this attenuation was only very small (mean attenuation, 5.6%). disodium cromoglycate affected neither the rightward shift of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses nor the small rightward shift in beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated exercise tachycardia after 2 weeks' administration of terbutaline. tremulousness observed during the first few days of terbutaline administration disappeared after 4 to 8 days, indicating development of desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated noncardiovascular responses. this was not prevented by disodium cromoglycate. these results confirm that long-term beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist therapy leads to a desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular and noncardiovascular effects in humans in vivo. however, unlike ketotifen, cromolyn sodium is not able to attenuate this desensitization.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ monocarboxylate transporters in the central nervous system: distribution, regulation and function. monocarboxylate transporters (mcts) are proton-linked membrane carriers involved in the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, as well as ketone bodies. they belong to a larger family of transporters composed of 14 members in mammals based on sequence homologies. mcts are found in various tissues including the brain where three isoforms, mct1, mct2 and mct4, have been described. each of these isoforms exhibits a distinct regional and cellular distribution in rodent brain. at the cellular level, mct1 is expressed by endothelial cells of microvessels, by ependymocytes as well as by astrocytes. mct4 expression appears to be specific for astrocytes. by contrast, the predominant neuronal monocarboxylate transporter is mct2. interestingly, part of mct2 immunoreactivity is located at postsynaptic sites, suggesting a particular role of monocarboxylates and their transporters in synaptic transmission. in addition to variation in expression during development and upon nutritional modifications, new data indicate that mct expression is regulated at the translational level by neurotransmitters. understanding how transport of monocarboxylates is regulated could be of particular importance not only for neuroenergetics but also for areas such as functional brain imaging, regulation of food intake and glucose homeostasis, or for central nervous system disorders such as ischaemia and neurodegenerative diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ self-cancellation of drug properties as a mode of organ selectivity: the antimuscarinic effects of ambenonium. ambenonium is known to be an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, and recent data have shown this drug to antagonize muscarinic receptors as well. this latter property was confirmed by schild analyses of ambenonium-induced blockade of responses to bethanechol in guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle, taenia caeci, trachea and rat anococcygeus muscle. statistical analysis showed ambenonium to be a simple competitive antagonist of responses to bethanechol in these tissues with pkb values in each tissue not significantly different from each other (mean pkb = 6.0). however, considerable variability in pkb estimates was encountered when ambenonium was utilized to block responses to acetylcholine. ambenonium was a less potent antagonist of tissue responses to acetylcholine, and the underestimation in the pkb (as compared to that obtained with bethanechol) could be eliminated by prior treatment of tissues with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine. these data suggested that ambenonium had a dual effect on tissue responses to acetylcholine-producing potentiation by blockade of acetylcholinesterase and concomitant antagonism by blockade of muscarinic receptors. the schild regressions obtained for ambenonium antagonism of acetylcholine responses formally satisfied criteria for simple competitive antagonism of a homogenous population of receptors (linear regression, slope equal to unity). the fact that these regressions yielded erroneous apparent pkb values suggests how two properties of a drug in one molecule could provide misleading information about drug receptors.(abstract truncated at 250 words)$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ enzymatic catalysis in crystals of escherichia coli maltodextrin phosphorylase. the bacterial enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase (malp) catalyses the phosphorolysis of an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond in maltodextrins, removing the non-reducing glucosyl residues of linear oligosaccharides as glucose-1-phosphate (glc1p). in contrast to the well-studied muscle glycogen phosphorylase (gp), malp exhibits no allosteric properties and has a higher affinity for linear oligosaccharides than gp. we have used malp as a model system to study catalysis in the crystal in the direction of maltodextrin synthesis. the 2.0a crystal structure of the malp/glc1p binary complex shows that the glc1p substrate adopts a conformation seen previously with both inactive and active forms of mammalian gp, with the phosphate group not in close contact with the 5'-phosphate group of the essential pyridoxal phosphate (plp) cofactor. in the active malp enzyme, the residue arg569 stabilizes the negative-charged glc1p, whereas in the inactive form of gp this key residue is held away from the catalytic site by loop 280s and an allosteric transition of the mammalian enzyme is required for activation. the comparison between malp structures shows that his377, through a hydrogen bond with the 6-hydroxyl group of glc1p substrate, triggers a conformational change of the 380s loop. this mobile region folds over the catalytic site and contributes to the specific recognition of the oligosaccharide and to the synergism between substrates in promoting the formation of the malp ternary complex. the structures solved after the diffusion of oligosaccharides (either maltotetraose, g4 or maltopentaose, g5) into malp/glc1p crystals show the formation of phosphate and elongation of the oligosaccharide chain. these structures, refined at 1.8a and at 2.2a, confirm that only when an oligosaccharide is bound to the catalytic site will glc1p bend its phosphate group down so it can contact the plp 5' phosphate group and promote catalysis. the relatively large oligosaccharide substrates can diffuse quickly into the malp/glc1p crystals and the enzymatic reaction can occur without significant crystal damage. these structures obtained before and after catalysis have been used as frames of a molecular movie. this movie reveals the relative positions of substrates in the catalytic channel and shows a minimal movement of the protein, involving mainly arg569, which tracks the substrate phosphate group.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ amezinium and debrisoquine are substrates of uptake1 and potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase in perfused lungs of rats. previous studies have resulted in the classification of amezinium as a selective inhibitor of neuronal monoamine oxidase (mao), because it is a much more potent mao inhibitor in intact tissues, in which it is accumulated in noradrenergic neurones by uptake1, than in tissue homogenates. in the present study, the effects of amezinium on the deamination of noradrenaline were investigated in intact lungs of rats, since the pulmonary endothelial cells are a site where the catecholamine transporter is non-neuronal uptake1. in addition, another drug that is both a substrate of uptake1 and a mao inhibitor, debrisoquine, was investigated in the study. the first aim of the study was to show whether amezinium and debrisoquine are substrates of uptake1 in rat lungs. after loading of isolated perfused lungs with 3h-noradrenaline (mao and catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) inhibited), the efflux of 3h-noradrenaline was measured for 30 min. when 1 mumol/l amezinium or 15 mumol/l debrisoquine was added for the last 15 min of efflux, there was a rapid and marked increase in the fractional rate of loss of 3h-noradrenaline, which was reduced by about 70% when 1 mumol/l desipramine was present throughout the efflux period. these results showed that both drugs were substrates for uptake1 in rat lungs. in lungs perfused with 1 nmol/l 3h-noradrenaline (comt inhibited), 10, 30 and 300 nmol/l amezinium caused 58%, 76% and 74% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination, respectively, and 30, 300 and 3000 nmol/l debrisoquine caused 56%, 89% and 96% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination, respectively. when mao-b was also inhibited, 10 nmol/l amezinium caused 84% inhibition of the deamination of noradrenaline by mao-a in the lungs. in contrast, in hearts perfused with 10 nmol/l 3h-noradrenaline under conditions where the amine was accumulated by uptake2 (comt, uptake1 and vesicular transport inhibited), 10 nmol/l amezinium had no effect and 300 nmol/l amezinium caused only 36% inhibition of deamination of noradrenaline. the results when considered with previous reports in the literature show that amezinium is about 1000 times more potent and debrisoquine is about 20 times more potent for mao inhibition in rat lungs than in tissue homogenates, and the reason for their high potencies in the intact lungs is transport and accumulation of the drugs in the pulmonary endothelial cells by uptake1. amezinium is much less potent as a mao inhibitor in cells with the uptake2 transporter, such as the myocardial cells of the heart. the results also confirmed previous reports that amezinium is highly selective for mao-a.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ dna polymerase polq and cellular defense against dna damage. in mammalian cells, polq (pol θ) is an unusual specialized dna polymerase whose in vivo function is under active investigation. polq has been implicated by different experiments to play a role in resistance to ionizing radiation and defense against genomic instability, in base excision repair, and in immunological diversification. the protein is formed by an n-terminal helicase-like domain, a c-terminal dna polymerase domain, and a large central domain that spans between the two. this arrangement is also found in the drosophila mus308 protein, which functions in resistance to dna interstrand crosslinking agents. homologs of polq and mus308 are found in multicellular eukaryotes, including plants, but a comparison of phenotypes suggests that not all of these genes are functional orthologs. flies defective in mus308 are sensitive to dna interstrand crosslinking agents, while mammalian cells defective in polq are primarily sensitive to dna double-strand breaking agents. cells from polq(-/-) mice are hypersensitive to radiation and peripheral blood cells display increased spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced levels of micronuclei (a hallmark of gross chromosomal aberrations), though mice apparently develop normally. loss of polq in human and mouse cells causes sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other double strand breaking agents and increased dna damage signaling. retrospective studies of clinical samples show that higher levels of polq gene expression in breast and colorectal cancer are correlated with poorer outcomes for patients. a clear understanding of the mechanism of action and physiologic function of polq in the cell is likely to bear clinical relevance.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ amphetamine-type central nervous system stimulants release norepinephrine more potently than they release dopamine and serotonin. a large body of evidence supports the hypothesis that mesolimbic dopamine (da) mediates, in animal models, the reinforcing effects of central nervous system stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. the role da plays in mediating amphetamine-type subjective effects of stimulants in humans remains to be established. both amphetamine and cocaine increase norepinephrine (ne) via stimulation of release and inhibition of reuptake, respectively. if increases in ne mediate amphetamine-type subjective effects of stimulants in humans, then one would predict that stimulant medications that produce amphetamine-type subjective effects in humans should share the ability to increase ne. to test this hypothesis, we determined, using in vitro methods, the neurochemical mechanism of action of amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (mdma), (+)-methamphetamine, ephedrine, phentermine, and aminorex. as expected, their rank order of potency for da release was similar to their rank order of potency in published self-administration studies. interestingly, the results demonstrated that the most potent effect of these stimulants is to release ne. importantly, the oral dose of these stimulants, which produce amphetamine-type subjective effects in humans, correlated with the their potency in releasing ne, not da, and did not decrease plasma prolactin, an effect mediated by da release. these results suggest that ne may contribute to the amphetamine-type subjective effects of stimulants in humans.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ sirt1 inhibits nadph oxidase activation and protects endothelial function in the rat aorta: implications for vascular aging. vascular aging is characterized by up-regulation of nadph oxidase, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. previous studies demonstrate that the activity of the evolutionarily conserved nad(+)-dependent deacetylase sirt1 declines with age and that pharmacological activators of sirt1 confer significant anti-aging cardiovascular effects. to determine whether dysregulation of sirt1 promotes nadph oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and impairs endothelial function we assessed the effects of three structurally different inhibitors of sirt1 (nicotinamide, sirtinol, ex527) in aorta segments isolated from young wistar rats. inhibition of sirt1 induced endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the significantly reduced relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore a23187. endothelial dysfunction induced by sirt1 inhibition was prevented by treatment of the vessels with the nadph oxidase inhibitor apocynin or superoxide dismutase. inhibition of sirt1 significantly increased vascular superoxide production, enhanced nadph oxidase activity, and mrna expression of its subunits p22(phox) and nox4, which were prevented by resveratrol. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (pparα) activation mimicked the effects of resveratrol while pparα inhibition prevented the effects of this sirt1 activator. sirt1 co-precipitated with pparα and nicotinamide increased the acetylation of the pparα coactivator pgc-1α, which was suppressed by resveratrol. in conclusion, impaired activity of sirt1 induces endothelial dysfunction and up-regulates nadph oxidase-derived ros production in the vascular wall, mimicking the vascular aging phenotype. moreover, a new mechanism for controlling endothelial function after sirt1 activation involves a decreased pgc-1α acetylation and the subsequent pparα activation, resulting in both decreased nadph oxidase-driven ros production and no inactivation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ molecular characterization of the surface of apoptotic neutrophils: implications for functional downregulation and recognition by phagocytes. we have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies and lectins to examine the profile of surface molecule expression on human neutrophils that have undergone spontaneous apoptosis during in vitro culture. neutrophil apoptosis was found to be accompanied by down-regulation of the immunoglobulin superfamily members pecam-1 (cd31), icam-3 (cd50), cd66acde, and cd66b and the integrin-associated proteins cd63 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (cd87) that may alter the potential for adhesive interactions. cellular interactions may be further influenced by the reduction of the expression of surface carbohydrate moieties, including sialic acid. reduced expression of fcgammarii (cd32), complement receptor type 1 (cd35) and receptors for pro-inflammatory mediators c5a (cd88) and tnfalpha (cd120b) associated with apoptosis might limit neutrophil responsiveness to stimuli that trigger degranulation responses. although many of the receptors we have examined are expressed at reduced levels on apoptotic neutrophils, we found that there was differential loss of certain receptors (e.g. cd16, cd15 and cd120b) and increased expression of aminopeptidase-n (cd13). together with our previous data showing that expression of certain molecules e.g. lfa-3 (cd58) is not altered during neutrophil apoptosis, these data are suggestive of specific changes in receptor mobilisation and shedding associated with apoptosis. although reduced expression of cd63 (azurophilic granules) and cr1 (specific granules) indicates that granule mobilisation does not accompany apoptosis, a monoclonal antibody (bob78), that recognises a 90 kda antigen localised in intracellular granules, defines a subpopulation of apoptotic neutrophils that exhibit nuclear degradation yet retain intact plasma membranes. bob78 positive neutrophils were found to bind biotinylated thrombospondin, suggesting that this mab defines surface molecular changes associated with exposure of thrombospondin binding moieties.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the factor vii-activating protease (fsap) enhances the activity of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (bmp-2). factor vii-activating protease (fsap) is a circulating protease involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, calcification, and fibrotic processes. to understand how fsap controls the balance of local growth factors, we have investigated its effect on the regulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps). bmp-2 is produced as a large pro-form and secreted as a mature heparin-binding growth factor after intracellular processing by pro-protein convertases (pcs). in this study, we discovered that fsap enhances the biological activity of mature bmp-2 as well as its pro-form, as shown by osteogenic differentiation of c2c12 myoblasts. these findings were complemented by knockdown of fsap in hepatocytes, which revealed bmp-2 processing by endogenous fsap. n-terminal sequencing indicated that pro-bmp-2 was cleaved by fsap at the canonical pc cleavage site, giving rise to mature bmp-2 (arg(282)↓gln(283)), as well as in the n-terminal heparin binding region of mature bmp-2, generating a truncated mature bmp-2 peptide (arg(289)↓lys(290)). similarly, mature bmp-2 was also cleaved to a truncated peptide within its n-terminal region (arg(289)↓lys(290)). plasmin exhibited a similar activity, but it was weaker compared with fsap. thrombin, factor viia, factor xa, and activated protein c were not effective. these results were further supported by the observation that the mutation of the heparin binding region of bmp-2 inhibited the processing by fsap but not by pc. thus, the proteolysis and activation of pro-bmp-2 and mature bmp-2 by fsap can regulate cell differentiation and calcification in vasculature and may explain why polymorphisms in the gene encoding for fsap are related to vascular diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ pterostilbene exerts antitumor activity against human osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the jak2/stat3 signaling pathway. osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignant bone tumor. pterostilbene (pte) is a natural, dimethylated analog of resveratrol with higher bioavailability. while pte has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of pte remain largely unknown. the janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (jak2/stat3) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. in this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of pte against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of jak2/stat3 and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of pte. pte treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. additionally, pte exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (mmp) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ros) and several biochemical parameters. furthermore, pte treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of jak2 at tyr 1007 and the downstream activation of stat3. pte also down-regulated the expression of stat3 target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-xl and mcl-1, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (bax, bak, cytosolic cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27. pte, used in combination with a known jak2/stat3 inhibitor, ag490, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells. taken together, pte is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma cell growth that targets the jak2/stat3 signaling pathway. these data suggest that inhibition of jak2/stat3 signaling is a novel mechanism of action for pte during therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma cancers.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ endogenous opioid systems and alcohol addiction. alcohol exerts numerous pharmacological effects through its interaction with various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. among the latter, the endogenous opioids play a key role in the rewarding (addictive) properties of ethanol. three types of opioid receptors (mu, delta and kappa) represent the respective targets of the major opioid peptides (beta-endorphin, enkephalins and dynorphins, respectively). the rewarding (reinforcing) properties of mu- and delta-receptor ligands are brought by activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system which ascends from the ventral tegmentum of the midbrain (vta) to rostral structures; of these, the nucleus accumbens (nac) is of particular importance in drug addiction. in contrast, dysphoria results from activation of kappa-receptors. the neurochemical manifestations of these opposing effects are, respectively, increases and decreases in dopamine release in the nac. several lines of evidence indicate that alcohol interferes with endogenous opioid mechanisms which are closely linked with dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic pathway. the view that condensation products of dopamine and alcohol-derived aldehyde (tetrahydroisoquinolines) play a role remains controversial. there is, however, much information on the direct (acute and chronic) effects of alcohol on the binding properties of opioid receptors, as well as modulation of opioid peptide synthesis and secretion (e.g. a suggested increase in beta-endorphin release). in view of the reinforcing properties of alcohol, it is relevant to consider behavioural studies involving alcohol self-administration in rodents and primates. low doses of morphine have been found to increase, and higher doses of the opiate to decrease, alcohol consumption. conversely, opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone (which bind to non-selectively opioid receptors) have been shown to decrease alcohol consumption under various experimental conditions. similar results have been reported when selective mu- or delta-receptor antagonists are administered. results obtained in genetic models of high preference for alcohol also support the view that alcohol intake depends on the activity of the endogenous opioid reward system and that alcohol consumption may serve to compensate for inherent deficits in this system. one hypothetical model proposes that reward results from activation of mu-opioid receptors in the vta and/or delta-receptor in the nac; both these nuclei are targets of endogenous beta-endorphin. it is suggested that alcohol interferes with this reward pathway either directly or indirectly. the available experimental data accord well with those obtained from clinical studies which opioid antagonists have been used to prevent relapse in alcoholics. conceptual considerations concerning communalities between various forms of addictions are also discussed in this review.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ cardiac effects of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist brl35135 in man. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist brl35135, and determine whether beta 3-receptors are involved in mediating chronotropic or inotropic responses in man. eight normal males received single oral doses of brl35135 8 mg (brl) or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol 8 mg (sal), after pretreatment with either placebo (pl), bisoprolol 5 mg (b5) as a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, or nadolol 20 mg (n20) to block beta 1- and beta 2- but not beta 3-receptors. both brl and sal produced a significant increase in postural finger tremor in keeping with beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, and this response was totally abolished by pretreatment with n20. significant increases in systolic blood pressure and doppler stroke distance occurred with brl and sal which were unaffected by pretreatment with b5 and completely blocked by n20, in keeping with beta 2-mediated effects. brl and sal produced significant chronotropic and minute distance responses which were unaffected by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. however, whereas n20 blocked these responses to sal, a small but significant response occurred with brl in comparison with placebo despite complete blockade of co-existing beta 2-mediated effects. compared with pl, the mean responses to n20/brl, and the 95% confidence interval for the differences between the means were 7.4 beats min-1 [3.2 to 11.6] (p = 0.002) for heart rate, and 208.8 cm [38.3 to 379.3] (p = 0.02) for minute distance responses.(abstract truncated at 250 words)$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the transporters glyt2 and viaat cooperate to determine the vesicular glycinergic phenotype. the mechanisms that specify the vesicular phenotype of inhibitory interneurons in vertebrates are poorly understood because the two main inhibitory transmitters, glycine and gaba, share the same vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (viaat) and are both present in neurons during postnatal development. we have expressed viaat and the plasmalemmal transporters for glycine and gaba in a neuroendocrine cell line and measured the quantal release of glycine and gaba using a novel double-sniffer patch-clamp technique. we found that glycine is released from vesicles when viaat is coexpressed with either the neuronal transporter glyt2 or the glial transporter glyt1. however, glyt2 was more effective than glyt1, probably because glyt2 is unable to operate in the reverse mode, which gives it an advantage in maintaining the high cytosolic glycine concentration required for efficient vesicular loading by viaat. the vesicular inhibitory phenotype was gradually altered from glycinergic to gabaergic through mixed events when gaba is introduced into the secretory cell and competes for uptake by viaat. interestingly, the viaat ortholog from caenorhabditis elegans (unc-47), a species lacking glycine transmission, also supports glycine exocytosis in the presence of glyt2, and a point mutation of unc-47 that abolishes gaba transmission in the worm confers glycine specificity. together, these results suggest that an increased cytosolic availability of glycine in viaat-containing terminals was crucial for the emergence of glycinergic transmission in vertebrates.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ suppression of zip8 expression is a common feature of cadmium-resistant and manganese-resistant rbl-2h3 cells. rat basophilic leukemia rbl-2h3 cells show markedly high sensitivity to both cdcl2 and mncl2 compared with other rat cell lines, due to efficient accumulation of cadmium and manganese. to clarify the roles of metal transporters in hyperaccumulation of cadmium and manganese in rbl-2h3 cells, cd-resistant and mn-resistant cells were developed from rbl-2h3 cells by continuous exposure to cdcl2 and mncl2, respectively. the established cd-resistant (rbl-cdr) and mn-resistant (rbl-mnr) cells exhibited about 20 times higher lc50 values of cdcl2 and mncl2, respectively, than parental rbl-2h3 cells, and showed cross-resistance to each metal. the resistance to cadmium and manganese was primarily conferred by a marked decrease in the uptake of both metals. rbl-cdr cells also showed cross-resistance to hgcl2 and agno3 probably due to enhanced expression of metallothionein. among the possible transporters involved in the uptake of cd(2+) and mn(2+), the expression of zip8 (zrt-, irt-related protein 8), encoded by slc39a8, showed a marked suppression in both rbl-cdr and rbl-mnr cells. these results suggest that zip8 plays a pivotal role in the transport and toxicity of cd(2+) and mn(2+) in rbl-2h3 cells.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ chromosomal localization, gene structure, and expression pattern of ddah1: comparison with ddah2 and implications for evolutionary origins. endogenously produced asymmetrically methylated arginine residues are competitive inhibitors of all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (nos). the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (ddah) specifically hydrolyzes these asymmetrically methylated arginine residues to citrulline and methylamines. previously we have proposed that regulation of asymmetric methylarginine concentration by ddah may provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of nos activity in vivo. recently we reported the cloning of human ddah and identified a novel human ddah isoform (ddah i and ddah ii, respectively). here we report that the ddah1 gene maps to chromosome 1p22 and confirm that ddah2 maps to the mhc iii region of chromosome 6p21.3. extensive analysis of the distribution of ddah1 and ddah2 mrna in 50 human tissues indicates differential expression of ddah isoforms in brain regions, in immune cells, and during development. ddah2 expression predominates in highly vascularized tissues that express the endothelial nos isoform and in immune tissues that can express inos. whereas ddah2 is expressed at relatively high levels in all fetal tissues examined, ddah1 expression varies little between fetal and adult tissues. the chromosomal localization of the ddahs is consistent with gene duplication, and consistent with this, comparison of the gene structures indicates that the intron/exon organization is highly conserved. phylogenetic analysis of ddah sequences from diverse species suggests that ddah gene duplication occurred prior to the emergence of bony fish some 400 million years ago. overall the data suggest that ddah2 may be the more ancient of the two genes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(saffron) against subchronic diazinon (dzn) induced cardiotoxicity in rats. methods: rats were divided into 7 groups; control (corn oil, gavage), dzn (15mg/kg/day, gavage,), crocin (12.5, 25 or 50mg/kg/day, i.p) plus dzn, vitamin e (200iu/kg, i.p, three times per week) plus dzn and crocin (50mg/kg/day, i.p) groups. treatments were continued for 4weeks. creatine phosphokinase mb (ck-mb), malondealdehyde (mda) and glutathione (gsh) levels were evaluated in heart tissue at the end of treatments. levels of apoptotic proteins (bax, bcl2, caspase 3) and cytosolic cytochrome c were analyzed by western blotting. transcript levels of bax and bcl2 were also determined using qrt pcr. results: dzn induced histophatological damages and elevated the level of cardiac marker ck-mb. these effects were associated with increased mda level, lower level of reduced gsh and induction of apoptosis through elevation of bax/bcl2 ratio (both protein and mrna levels), cytochrome c release to the cytosol and activation caspase 3 in cardiac tissue. crocin (25 and 50mg/kg) or vitamin e improved histopathological damages, decreased mda and ck-mb, increased gsh content and attenuated the increase of bax/bcl2 ratio, activation of caspase 3 and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol induced by dzn. in summary, dzn induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in heart tissue of rat following subchronic exposure. crocin, as an antioxidant, showed protective effects against dzn cardiotoxicity by reducing lipid peroxidation and alleviating apoptosis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ antizyme inhibitor is rapidly induced in growth-stimulated mouse fibroblasts and releases ornithine decarboxylase from antizyme suppression. ornithine decarboxylase (odc) catalyses the first step in the synthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine. the polyamines are essential for cell growth, but at elevated levels they may be tumorigenic, toxic, or may induce apoptosis. therefore, odc activity is highly regulated. it is induced when cells are stimulated to grow, and it is subjected to feedback inhibition by the polyamines. by causing ribosomal frameshifting, polyamines induce the synthesis of antizyme, a 23-kda protein, which binds to odc, inhibits its activity and promotes its degradation by the 26 s proteasome. antizyme, in turn, is inhibited by antizyme inhibitor (azi). we describe the cloning of a mouse azi cdna, encoding a protein with high homology to mouse odc. using purified recombinant proteins, we show that azi (which has no odc activity) can release enzymically active odc from antizyme suppression in vitro. we also show that odc reactivation takes place in mouse fibroblasts upon transient transfection with an azi-expressing plasmid construct. finally we demonstrate that the azi mrna content of mouse fibroblasts increases significantly within an hour of growth stimulation, i.e. much earlier than odc transcripts. our results indicate that induction of azi synthesis may represent a means of rescuing odc molecules that have been inactivated and tagged for degradation by antizyme, when culture conditions improve and polyamine production is needed for cell growth and proliferation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ characterization of an alpha 1d-adrenoceptor mediating the contractile response of rat aorta to noradrenaline. 1. the affinities of a number of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined by displacement of [3h]-prazosin binding from cloned human alpha 1a-adrenoceptors (previously designated cloned alpha 1c subtype), alpha 1b alpha 1d and rat alpha 1d-adrenoceptors, stably expressed in rat-1 fibroblasts. functional affinity estimates for these compounds were also determined from noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta. 2. bmy 7378 displayed high affinity for cloned human alpha 1d-adrenoceptors (pki = 8.2 +/- 0.10) and was selective over alpha 1a (pki = 6.2 +/- 0.10) and alpha 1b subtypes (6.7 +/- 0.11). wb 4101, benoxathian and phentolamine displayed high affinity for alpha 1a and alpha 1d adrenoceptors compared to the alpha 1b subtype. spiperone displayed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1b adrenoceptors (pki 8.8 +/- 0.16). 5-methyl-urapidil was selective for cloned alpha 1a adrenoceptors. 3. comparative binding affinities (pki) for compounds at cloned human and rat1d adrenoceptors were almost identical (r = 0.99, slope = 1.08). 4. prazosin, doxazosin and 5-methyl-urapidil were potent, competitive antagonists of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta (pa2 values of 9.8, 8.8 and 7.8 respectively). the selective alpha 1d antagonist bmy 7378 was also a potent antagonist on rat aorta (pkb = 8.3 +/- 0.1) but the interaction of this compound was not consistent with competitive antagonism at a single population of receptors. 5. functional affinities for compounds determined against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta correlated well with binding affinities at cloned alpha 1d-adrenoceptors (r = 0.96), but not with alpha 1a (r = 0.61) or alpha 1b (r = 0.46) subtypes. 6. noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta were sensitive to the alkylating effects of chlorethylclonidine (cec). cec (10 microm) caused a small rightward shift in the noradrenaline concentration-response curve. cec at 100 microm caused a further shift and suppression of the maximum response to noradrenaline.7. the results of this study suggest that noradrenaline predominantly, but not exclusively, mediates contraction of rat aorta through the activation of an alphald-adrenoceptor.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ [inactivated factor vii exercises a powerful antithrombotic activity in an experimental model of recurrent arterial thrombosis]. the extrinsic coagulation pathway is activated when tissue factor (tf) is exposed as a consequence of arterial damage. tf binds to factor vii (fvii) or activated fvii (fviia), generating a complex that activates both fx and fix, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. to determine whether inhibition of fvii binding to tf would result in antithrombotic effects, active site-blocked fviia (fviiai) was used in a rabbit model of intravascular thrombus formation. in addition, to study the interaction between extrinsic coagulation pathway activation and platelet aggregation, in the same model of intravascular thrombus formation, recombinant human fviia was administered in antiplatelet-treated rabbits. cyclic flow variations (cfvs), due to recurrent thrombus formation, were initiated by placing an external constrictor around the endothelially-injured rabbit carotid arteries (folt's model). carotid blood flow was measured continuously by a doppler flow probe placed proximally to the constrictor. cfvs were induced in 29 new zealand white rabbits. after cfvs were observed for 30 min, the animals were randomly divided in four groups: 5 animals received via a small catheter (26g) placed proximally to the stenosis, an intra-arterial infusion of human recombinant fviiai (0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min); 9 animals received ap-1, a monoclonal antibody against rabbit tf (0.1 mg/kg i.v. bolus); 7 animals received ridogrel, a dual thromboxane a2 synthetase inhibitor and thromboxane a2 receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus); finally, 8 rabbits received aurintrycarboxilic acid (ata), an inhibitor of platelet glycoprotein ib/von willebrand factor interaction (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus). fviiai abolished cfvs in 5 of 5 animals (cfv frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 106 +/- 9% of the baseline values; ns vs baseline). ap-1 abolished cfvs in 7 of 9 animals (cfv frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 58 +/- 35% of the baseline values; ns vs baseline). finally, in all the animals receiving ridogrel or ata cfvs were abolished (cfv frequency 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05 in both groups; carotid blood flow velocity, respectively 62 +/- 32 and 66 +/- 40% of the baseline values; ns vs baseline in both groups). thirty minutes following inhibition of cfvs, in the fviiai treated rabbits, human recombinant fviia was infused, via the small catheter placed proximally to the stenosis, at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min. in the other three groups, fviia, at the same dose, was infused i.v. infusion of fviia restored cfvs in all fviiai treated animals and in 6 of 7 ap-1 treated animals, thus indicating that ap-1 and fviiai bindings to tf was competitive and was replaced by fviia. infusion of fviia failed to restore cfvs in ridogrel e ata treated rabbits (1 of 7 and 0 of 8 rabbits, respectively), showing that activation of extrinsic coagulation by fviia was overcome by inhibition of platelet function. activated partial thromboplastin time, and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to adp and thrombin, were not different after fviiai infusion, while prothrombin time was slightly but significantly prolonged as compared to baseline values. thus, fvii-viia plays an important role in initiating thrombus formation in vivo. administration of fviiai exerts a potent antithrombotic effects in this model without affecting systemic coagulation. in addition, in this model platelets exert an important role in arterial thrombosis, since in the presence of inhibition of platelet function, activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway failed to restore thrombus formation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells is mediated by ras homologous a protein (rho a) via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. despite the availability of melanoma treatment at the primary site, the recurrence of local melanoma can metastasize to any distant organ. currently, the available therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma are of limited benefit. thus, the functional analysis of conventional therapies may help to improve their efficiency in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. in the present study, the exposure of melanoma cells to vinblastine was found to trigger apoptosis as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor, activation of caspase-9 and 3, and cleavage of poly (adp-ribose)-polymerase. also, vinblastine enhances the phosphorylation of ras homologous protein a, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the release of intracellular ca(2+), as well as the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-jun-n-terminal kinase, p38, inhibitor of kappabα (iκbα) kinase, and inositol requiring enzyme 1α. in addition, vinblastine induces the dna-binding activities of the transcription factor nf-κb, hsf1, ap-1, and atf-2, together with the expression of hsp70 and bax proteins. moreover, inhibitory experiments addressed a central role for rho a in the regulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. in conclusion, the present study addresses for the first time a central role for rho a in the modulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells and thereby provides an insight into the molecular action of vinblastine in melanoma treatment.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ rivastigmine for alzheimer's disease. background: alzheimer's disease (ad) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. one of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and low risk of adverse effects, have now been introduced. rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the european union and the usa. objectives: to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of alzheimer's type. search strategy: the specialized register of the cochrane dementia and cognitive improvement group (cdcig), the cochrane library, medline, embase, psycinfo, cinahl and lilacs were searched on 27 march 2008 using the terms: rivastigmine or exelon or ena or "sdz ena 713" . the cdcig specialized register contains records from all major health care databases (the cochrane library, medline, embase, psycinfo, cinahl, lilacs) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. selection criteria: all unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the alzheimer's type for more than two weeks and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. data collection and analysis: one reviewer (jsb) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. main results: nine trials, involving 4775 participants, were included in the analyses. use of rivastigmine in high doses was associated with statistically significant benefits on several measures. high-dose rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily) was associated with a two-point improvement in cognitive function on the adas-cog score compared with placebo (weighted mean difference -1.99, 95% confidence interval -2.49 to -1.50, on an intention-to-treat basis) and a 2.2 point improvement in activities of daily living assessed on the progressive deterioration scale (weighted mean difference -2.15, 95% confidence interval -3.16 to -1.13, on an intention-to-treat basis) at 26 weeks. at lower doses (4 mg daily or lower) differences were in the same direction but were statistically significant only for cognitive function. there were statistically significantly higher numbers of events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, headache, syncope, abdominal pain and dizziness among patients taking high-dose rivastigmine than among those taking placebo. there was some evidence that adverse events might be less common with more frequent, smaller doses of rivastigmine. the 2008 update includes a new study testing two types of rivastigmine transdermal patch, one delivering a higher dose than previously tested (17.4 mg/day) and a smaller patch delivering 9.6 mg/day. the efficacy of the smaller patch was not significantly different compared with the capsules of similar daily dose, but was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and asthenia. the efficacy of the larger patch was not significantly different compared with the smaller patch, but the smaller patch was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dizziness. there appears to be advantages associated with the smaller patch compared with both the higher dose patch and the 6-12 mg/day capsules. authors' conclusions: rivastigmine appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate alzheimer's disease. in comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and severity of dementia with daily doses of 6 to 12 mg. adverse events were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug. a transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both. this review has not examined economic data.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ tcdd induces the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 in 5l rat hepatoma cells: a cautionary tale of the use of this cell line in studies on dioxin toxicity. previous quantitative proteomic studies on the actions of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) in 5l rat hepatoma cells, a cell model frequently used for investigating the mechanisms of tcdd toxicity, had indicated that dioxin exposure reduced the abundance of numerous proteins which are regulated at the level of protein synthesis initiation. in the present study, we have analysed the mechanism mediating this inhibition. tcdd treatment of the cells largely prevented the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein 1, a regulator of translation initiation and substrate of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor). by "working upwards" from mtor, we observed that tcdd inhibited endogenous and igf-i-induced akt and erk activation by interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1. this inhibition was mediated by a tcdd-induced secreted factor which was identified as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (igfbp-4). the induction of igfbp-4 protein was dependent on a functional aryl hydrocarbon receptor and was preceded by a rapid increase in the level of igfbp-4 mrna indicating that igfbp-4 is a previously unknown transcriptional target of tcdd in 5l cells. igfbp-4 was not induced by tcdd in the parental cell line of 5l cells, fao, and in various closely related rat hepatoma cell lines as well as in other unrelated cell types. analysis of 5l cell chromosomes by multicolour spectral karyotyping (sky) revealed that the cells carry several hitherto uncharacterised chromosomal translocations. the observations suggest that in 5l cells the igfbp-4 gene may have got under the control of a promoter containing dioxin responsive element(s) leading to the induction of igfbp-4 by tcdd. these findings emphasise a particular caution when interpreting and extrapolating results on the action mechanisms of tcdd obtained in studies using 5l cells as a model system.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ sequestration of retinyl esters is essential for retinoid signaling in the zebrafish embryo. for vertebrate development, vitamin a (all-trans retinol) is required in quantitative different amounts and spatiotemporal distribution for the production of retinoic acid, a nuclear hormone receptor ligand, and 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments. we show here for zebrafish that embryonic retinoid homeostasis essentially depends on the activity of a leci-thin:retinol acyltransferase (lratb). during embryogenesis, lratb is expressed in mostly non-overlapping domains opposite to retinal dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), the key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis. blocking retinyl ester formation by a targeted knock down of lratb results in significantly increased retinoic acid levels, which lead to severe embryonic patterning defects. thus, we provide evidence that a balanced competition between lratb and raldh2 for yolk vitamin a defines embryonic compartments either for retinyl ester or retinoic acid synthesis. this homeostatic mechanism dynamically adjusts embryonic retinoic acid levels for gene regulation, concomitantly sequestering excess yolk vitamin a in the form of retinyl esters for the establishment of larval vision later during development.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ hormonal therapy of prostate cancer. of all cancers, prostate cancer is the most sensitive to hormones: it is thus very important to take advantage of this unique property and to always use optimal androgen blockade when hormone therapy is the appropriate treatment. a fundamental observation is that the serum testosterone concentration only reflects the amount of testosterone of testicular origin which is released in the blood from which it reaches all tissues. recent data show, however, that an approximately equal amount of testosterone is made from dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) directly in the peripheral tissues, including the prostate, and does not appear in the blood. consequently, after castration, the 95-97% fall in serum testosterone does not reflect the 40-50% testosterone (testo) and dihydrotestosterone (dht) made locally in the prostate from dhea of adrenal origin. in fact, while elimination of testicular androgens by castration alone has never been shown to prolong life in metastatic prostate cancer, combination of castration (surgical or medical with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) agonist) with a pure anti-androgen has been the first treatment shown to prolong life. most importantly, when applied at the localized stage, the same combined androgen blockade (cab) can provide long-term control or cure of the disease in more than 90% of cases. obviously, since prostate cancer usually grows and metastasizes without signs or symptoms, screening with prostate-specific antigen (psa) is absolutely needed to diagnose prostate cancer at an 'early' stage before metastasis occurs and the cancer becomes non-curable. while the role of androgens was believed to have become non-significant in cancer progressing under any form of androgen blockade, recent data have shown increased expression of the androgen receptor (ar) in treatment-resistant disease with a benefit of further androgen blockade. since the available anti-androgens have low affinity for ar and cannot block androgen action completely, especially in the presence of increased ar levels, it becomes important to discover more potent and purely antagonistic blockers of ar. the data obtained with compounds under development are promising. while waiting for this (these) new anti-androgen(s), combined treatment with castration and a pure anti-androgen (bicalutamide, flutamide or nilutamide) is the only available and the best scientifically based means of treating prostate cancer by hormone therapy at any stage of the disease with the optimal chance of success and even cure in localized disease.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ state-dependent mibefradil block of na+ channels. mibefradil is a t-type ca2+ channel antagonist with reported cross-reactivity with other classes of ion channels, including k+, cl-, and na+ channels. using whole-cell voltage clamp, we examined mibefradil block of four na+ channel isoforms expressed in human embryonic kidney cells: nav1.5 (cardiac), nav1.4 (skeletal muscle), nav1.2 (brain), and nav1.7 (peripheral nerve). mibefradil blocked nav1.5 in a use/frequency-dependent manner, indicating preferential binding to states visited during depolarization. mibefradil blocked currents of all na+ channel isoforms with similar affinity and a dependence on holding potential, and drug off-rate was slowed at depolarized potentials (k(off) was 0.024/s at -130 mv and 0.007/s at -100 mv for nav1.5). we further probed the interaction of mibefradil with inactivated nav1.5 channels. neither the degree nor the time course of block was dependent on the stimulus duration, which dramatically changed the residency time of channels in the fast-inactivated state. in addition, inhibiting the binding of the fast inactivation lid (nav1.5 icm + mtset) did not alter mibefradil block, confirming that the drug does not preferentially interact with the fast-inactivated state. we also tested whether mibefradil interacted with slow-inactivated state(s). when selectively applied to channels after inducing slow inactivation with a 60-s pulse to -10 mv, mibefradil (1 microm) produced 45% fractional block in nav1.5 and greater block (88%) in an isoform (nav1.4) that slow-inactivates more completely. our results suggest that mibefradil blocks na+ channels in a state-dependent manner that does not depend on fast inactivation but probably involves interaction with one or more slow-inactivated state(s).$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ antithrombin binding of low molecular weight heparins and inhibition of factor xa. fluorescence and stopped flow methods were used to compare clinically used heparins with regard to their ability to bind to antithrombin and to accelerate the inactivation of factor xa. titration of antithrombin with both low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) (enoxaparin, fragmin and ardeparin) and unfractionated heparin (ufh) produced an equivalent fluorescence increase and indicates similar affinity of all heparin preparations to antithrombin. however, relative to ufh enoxaparin, the lmwh with the smallest average molecular mass, contained only 12% material with high affinity for antithrombin. the rate of factor xa inhibition by antithrombin increased with the concentration of the examined heparins to the same limiting value, but the concentration required for maximal acceleration depended on the preparation. according to these data the high affinity fraction of the heparin preparations increased the intrinsic fluorescence and inhibitory activity equally without additional effects by variations in chain length and chemical composition. in contrast, in the presence of ca ufh accelerated the inhibition of factor xa by antithrombin 10-fold more efficiently than comparable concentrations of the high affinity fractions of enoxaparin and fragmin. the bell-shaped dependence of this accelerating effect suggests simultaneous binding of both proteins to heparin. in conclusion, under physiologic conditions the anti-factor xa activity of heparin results from a composite effect of chain length and the content of material with high affinity to antithrombin. thus, the reduced antithrombotic activity of lmwh relative to ufh results from a smaller content of high affinity material and the absence of a stimulating effect of calcium.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ parathyroid hormone (1-34) counteracts the suppression of interleukin-11 expression by glucocorticoid in murine osteoblasts: a possible mechanism for stimulating osteoblast differentiation against glucocorticoid excess. glucocorticoid (gc) excess causes a rapid loss of bone with a reduction in bone formation. intermittent pth (1-34) administration stimulates bone formation and counteracts the inhibition of bone formation by gc excess. we have previously demonstrated that mechanical strain enhances interleukin (il)-11 gene transcription by a rapid induction of δfosb expression and protein kinase c (pkc)-δ-mediated phosphorylation of phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic (smad)-1. because il-11 suppresses the expression of dickkopf-1 and -2 and stimulates wnt signaling, il-11 appears to mediate at least a part of the effect of mechanical strain on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. the present study was undertaken to examine the effect of pth(1-34) and gcs on il-11 expression in murine primary osteoblasts (mpobs). pth(1-34) treatment of mpobs enhanced il-11 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. pth(1-34) also stimulated δfosb expression and smad1 phosphorylation, which cooperatively stimulated il-11 gene transcription. pth(1-34)-induced smad1 phosphorylation was mediated via pkcδ and was abrogated in mpobs from pkcδ knockout mice. dexamethasone suppressed il-11 gene transcription enhanced by pth(1-34) without affecting δfosb expression or smad1 phosphorylation, and dexamethasone-gc receptor complex was bound to jund, which forms heterodimers with δfosb. high doses of pth(1-34) counteracted the effect of dexamethasone on apoptosis of mpobs, which was blunted by neutralizing anti-il-11 antibody or il-11 small interfering rna. these results demonstrate that pth(1-34) and gcs interact to regulate il-11 expression in parallel with osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis and suggest that pth(1-34) and dexamethasone may regulate osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis via their effect on il-11 expression.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ review article: 5-hydroxytryptamine agonists and antagonists in the modulation of gastrointestinal motility and sensation: clinical implications. serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) is found in the enteric nervous system where it has been implicated in controlling gastrointestinal motor function. a number of receptor or recognition sites have been identified in the gut, but recently most attention has focused on the 5-ht3 and 5-ht4 receptors. the functional role of the 5-ht3 receptor remains incompletely understood, but it is probably involved in the modulation of colonic motility and visceral pain in the gut. a number of selective 5-ht3 antagonists have been developed including ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron renzapride and zacopride. while the substituted benzamide prokinetics (for example, metoclopramide, cisapride) also block 5-ht3 receptors in high concentrations, their prokinetic action is believed to be on the basis of their agonist effects on the putative 5-ht4 receptor. some 5-ht3 antagonists have 5-ht4 agonist activity (for example, renzapride, zacopride) and others do not (for example, ondansetron, granisetron), while tropisetron in high concentrations is a 5-ht4 antagonist. based on the pharmacological data, it has been suggested that specific 5-ht antagonists and agonists may prove to be beneficial in a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain, gastrooesophageal reflux and refractory nausea. in this review, the rationale for the use of these compounds is discussed, and the available experimental evidence is summarized.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ dopamine d3 receptor-preferring agonists increase dendrite arborization of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. clinical improvements in parkinson's disease produced by dopamine d3 receptor-preferring agonists have been related to their neuroprotective actions and, more recently, to their neuroregenerative properties. however, it is unclear whether dopamine agonists produce their neurotrophic effects by acting directly on receptors expressed by the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons or indirectly on receptors expressed by astrocytes, via release of neurotrophic factors. in this study, we investigated the effects of the dopamine d3 receptor-preferring agonists quinpirole and 7-hydroxy-n,n-di-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-oh-dpat), as well as of the indirect agonist amphetamine, on dopaminergic neurons identified by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (th-ir). experiments were performed on neuronal-enriched primary cultures containing less than 0.5% of astrocytes prepared from the mouse embryo mesencephalon. after 3 days of incubation, both quinpirole (1-10 microm) and 7-oh-dpat (5-500 nm) dose-dependently increased the maximal dendrite length (p < 0.001), number of primary dendrites (p < 0.01) and [3h]dopamine uptake (p < 0.01) of th-ir-positive mesencephalic neurons. similar effects were observed with 10 microm amphetamine. all neurotrophic effects were blocked by the unselective d2/d3 receptor antagonist sulpiride (5 microm) and by the selective d3 receptor antagonist sb-277011-a at a low dose (50 nm). quinpirole and 7-oh-dpat also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) within minutes, an effect blocked by pretreatment with sb-277011-a. inhibition of the d2/d3 receptor signalling pathway to erk was obtained with pd98059, gf109203 or ly294002, resulting in blockade of neurotrophic effects. these data suggest that dopamine agonists increase dendritic arborizations of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via a direct effect on d2/d3 receptors, preferentially involving d3 receptor-dependent neurotransmission.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ na+/ca2+ exchange inhibitors: a new class of calcium regulators. the na(+)/ca(2+) exchanger (ncx) is a bidirectional transporter that normally extrudes ca(2+) from the cell (forward mode), but also brings ca(2+) into the cell (reverse mode) under special conditions such as intracellular na(+) (na(+)(i)) accumulation or membrane depolarization. there are three mammalian ncx isoforms: ncx1 is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of ncx2 and ncx3 is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. the pharmacology of ncx inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of kb-r7943, a prototype benzyloxyphenyl ncx inhibitor, in 1996. currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: sea0400, sn-6, and ym-244769. intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of benzyloxyphenyl ncx inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of na(+)(i)-dependent inactivation. therefore, the benzyloxyphenyl inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low na(+)(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high na(+)(i)). this should be an ideal profile for calcium regulators against na(+)(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. existing ion channel blockers, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, bepridil, aprindine, and cibenzoline, have been found to have an ncx inhibitory action. it is possible that this property is partly responsible for their antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects. this article presents the characteristics of selective and non-selective ncx inhibitors and their therapeutic potential as a new calcium regulator.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ robust autoactivation, chymotrypsin c independence and diminished secretion define a subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated cationic trypsinogen mutants. mutations in human cationic trypsinogen cause hereditary pancreatitis by altering its proteolytic regulation of activation and degradation by chymotrypsin c (ctrc). ctrc stimulates trypsinogen autoactivation by processing the activation peptide to a shorter form but also promotes degradation by cleaving the calcium binding loop in trypsinogen. mutations render trypsinogen resistant to ctrc-mediated degradation and/or increase processing of the activation peptide by ctrc. here we demonstrate that activation peptide mutations d19a, d22g, k23r and k23_i24insidk robustly increased the rate of trypsinogen autoactivation, both in the presence and absence of ctrc. degradation of the mutants by ctrc was unchanged and processing of the activation peptide was increased only in the d19a mutant by 4-fold. surprisingly, however, this increased processing had only a minimal effect on autoactivation. the tetra-aspartate motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide binds calcium (kd ~1.6 mm), which stimulates autoactivation. unexpectedly, calcium binding was not compromised by any of the activation peptide mutations. despite normal binding, autoactivation of mutants d22g and k23_i24insidk was not stimulated by calcium. finally, the activation peptide mutants exhibited reduced secretion from transfected cells, and secreted trypsinogen levels were inversely proportional with autoactivation rates. we conclude that d19a, d22g, k23r and k23_i24insidk form a mechanistically distinct subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated mutations, which exert their effect primarily through direct stimulation of autoactivation, independently of ctrc. the potentially severe clinical impact of the markedly increased autoactivation is offset by diminished secretion, resulting in a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from typical hereditary pancreatitis. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ beta1 adrenergic receptor-mediated enhancement of hippocampal ca3 network activity. norepinephrine is an endogenous neurotransmitter distributed throughout the mammalian brain. in higher cortical structures such as the hippocampus, norepinephrine, via beta adrenergic receptor (ar) activation, has been shown to reinforce the cognitive processes of attention and memory. in this study, we investigated the effect of beta1ar activation on hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (ca3) network activity. ar expression was first determined using immunocytochemistry with antibodies against beta1ars, which were found to be exceptionally dense in hippocampal ca3 pyramidal neurons. ca3 network activity was then examined in vitro using field potential recordings in rat brain slices. the selective betaar agonist isoproterenol caused an enhancement of hippocampal ca3 network activity, as measured by an increase in frequency of spontaneous burst discharges recorded in the ca3 region. in the presence of alphaar blockade, concentration-response curves for isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine suggested that a beta1ar was involved in this response, and the rank order of potency was isoproterenol > norepinephrine = epinephrine. finally, equilibrium dissociation constants (pk(b)) of subtype-selective betaar antagonists were functionally determined to characterize the ar subtype modulating hippocampal ca3 activity. the selective beta1ar antagonists atenolol and metoprolol blocked isoproterenol-induced enhancement, with apparent k(b) values of 85 +/- 36 and 3.9 +/- 1.7 nm, respectively. in contrast, the selective beta2ar antagonists ici-118,551 and butoxamine inhibited isoproterenol-mediated enhancement with apparent low affinities (k(b) of 222 +/- 61 and 9268 +/- 512 nm, respectively). together, this pharmacological profile of subtype-selective betaar antagonists indicates that in this model, beta1ar activation is responsible for the enhanced hippocampal ca3 network activity initiated by isoproterenol.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ characterization of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-related proteins (igfbp-rps) 1, 2, and 3 in human prostate epithelial cells: potential roles for igfbp-rp1 and 2 in senescence of the prostatic epithelium. insulin-like growth factor (igf)-binding protein (igfbp)-related proteins (igfbp-rps) are newly described cysteine-rich proteins that share significant aminoterminal structural similarity with the conventional igfbps and are involved in a diversity of biological functions, including growth regulation. igfbp-rp1 (mac25/angiomodulin/prostacyclin-stimulating factor) is a potential tumor-suppressor gene that is differentially expressed in meningiomas, mammary and prostatic cancers, compared with their malignant counterparts. we have previously shown that igfbp-rp1 is preferentially produced by primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells (hpecs) and by poorly tumorigenic p69sv40t cells, compared with the cancerous prostatic lncap, du145, pc-3, and m12 cells. we now show that igfbp-rp1 increases during senescence of hpec. igfbp-rp2 (also known as connective tissue growth factor), a downstream effector of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta and modulator of growth for both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, was detected in most of the normal and malignant prostatic epithelial cells tested, with a marked up-regulation of igfbp-rp2 during senescence of hpec. moreover, igfbp-rp2 noticeably increased in response to tgf-beta1 and all-trans retinoic acid (atra) in hpec and pc-3 cells, and it decreased in response to igf-i in hpec. igfbp-rp3 [nephroblastoma overexpressed (nov)], the protein product of the nov protooncogene, was not detected in hpec but was expressed in the tumorigenic du145 and pc-3 cells. it was also synthesized by the sv40-t antigen-transformed p69 and malignant m12 cells, where it was down-regulated by atra. these observations suggest biological roles of igfbp-rps in the human prostate. igfbp-rp1 and igfbp-rp2 are likely to negatively regulate growth, because they seem to increase during senescence of the prostate epithelium and in response to growth inhibitors (tgf-beta1 and atra). although the data collected on igfbp-rp3 in prostate are modest, its role as a growth stimulator and/or protooncogene is supported by its preferential expression in cancerous cells and its down-regulation by atra.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ p300-mediated acetylation of trf2 is required for maintaining functional telomeres. the human telomeric protein trf2 is required to protect chromosome ends by facilitating their organization into the protective capping structure. post-translational modifications of trf2 such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, methylation and poly(adp-ribosyl)ation have been shown to play important roles in telomere function. here we show that trf2 specifically interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, and that p300 acetylates the lysine residue at position 293 of trf2. we also report that p300-mediated acetylation stabilizes the trf2 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and is required for efficient telomere binding of trf2. furthermore, overexpression of the acetylation-deficient mutant, k293r, induces dna-damage response foci at telomeres, thereby leading to induction of impaired cell growth, cellular senescence and altered cell cycle distribution. a small but significant number of metaphase chromosomes show no telomeric signals at chromatid ends, suggesting an aberrant telomere structure. these findings demonstrate that acetylation of trf2 by p300 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of functional telomeres as well as in the regulation of the telomere-associated dna-damage response, thus providing a new route for modulating telomere protection function.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ ornithine metabolism in male and female rat kidney: mitochondrial expression of ornithine aminotransferase and arginase ii. in the kidney, l-ornithine is reabsorbed along the proximal convoluted tubule (pct), transported by basolateral carriers, and produced by arginase ii (aii). here, the renal metabolic fate of l-ornithine was analyzed in male and female rats. kidneys and renal zones were dissected and used for western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic studies. ornithine aminotransferase (oat) and aii were localized using specific antibodies. ornithine oxidation was determined by incubating microdissected tubules with l-[1-14c] or l-[u-14c]ornithine in the presence or absence of energy-providing substrates. ornithine decarboxylase (odc) mrnas were localized by in situ hybridization. the 48-kda oat protein was detected in male and female kidneys, but its level was fourfold higher in the latter. oat relative distribution increased from the superficial cortex toward the outer medulla to reach its highest level. almost all oat protein was localized in cortical and medullary proximal straight tubules (cpst and ospst, respectively). in proximal straight tubule (pst), aii protein distribution overlapped that of oat. no gender difference in aii protein level was found. oat and aii were colocalized within pst mitochondria. l-[1-14c]ornithine decarboxylation occurred in all tubules, but predominantly in proximal tubules. l-[1-14c]ornithine decarboxylation was enhanced when l-[1-14c]ornithine was given to tubules as the sole substrate. the use of l-[u-14c]ornithine demonstrated the complete oxidation of ornithine. in conclusion, the oat gene was expressed more in female rat proximal tubules than in male. because oat and aii proteins overlapped in pst mitochondria, l-arginine-derived ornithine may be preferentially converted to l-glutamate, as proven by ornithine oxidation. however, the coexpression of odc, glutamate decarboxylase, and glutamine synthetase in pst suggests that l-ornithine can also be metabolized to putrescine, gaba, and l-glutamine. the fate of l-ornithine may depend on the cellular context.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the characteristics of genistin-induced inhibitory effects on intestinal motility. genistin belongs to isoflavones. based on the facts that genistin exerts inhibitory effects on the contractility of vascular smooth muscle,the present study was designed to characterize the effects of genistin on intestinal contractility and evaluate its potential clinical implication. ex vivo [isolated jejunal segment (ijs) of rat], in vitro, and in vivo assays were used in the study. the results indicated that genistin (5-80 μmol/l) inhibited the contraction of ijs in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the increased-contractility of ijs induced by acetylcholine (ach), histamine, high ca(2+), and erythromycin, respectively. the inhibitory effects of genistin were correlated with the stimulation of alpha adrenergic and beta adrenergic receptors since these inhibitory effects were significantly blocked in the presence of phentolamine and propranolol respectively. no further inhibitory effects of genistin were observed in the presence of verapamil or in ca(2+)-free condition, indicating genistin-induced inhibitory effects are ca(2+)-dependent. genistin decreased myosin light chain kinase (mlck) protein contents and mlck mrna expression in ijs, and inhibited both phosphorylation and mg(2+)-atpase activity of purified myosin, implicating that the decrease of mlck contents and inhibition of mlck activity are involved in the genistin-induced inhibitory effects. the study suggests the potential clinical implications of genistin in relieving intestinal hypercontractility.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ metabolic pathways of inhaled glucocorticoids by the cyp3a enzymes. asthma is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world, for which the mainstay treatment has been inhaled glucocorticoids (gcs). despite the widespread use of these drugs, approximately 30% of asthma sufferers exhibit some degree of steroid insensitivity or are refractory to inhaled gcs. one hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is interpatient variability in the clearance of these compounds. the objective of this research is to determine how metabolism of gcs by the cyp3a family of enzymes could affect their effectiveness in asthmatic patients. in this work, the metabolism of four frequently prescribed inhaled gcs, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, by the cyp3a family of enzymes was studied to identify differences in their rates of clearance and to identify their metabolites. both interenzyme and interdrug variability in rates of metabolism and metabolic fate were observed. cyp3a4 was the most efficient metabolic catalyst for all the compounds, and cyp3a7 had the slowest rates. cyp3a5, which is particularly relevant to gc metabolism in the lungs, was also shown to efficiently metabolize triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate. in contrast, flunisolide was only metabolized via cyp3a4, with no significant turnover by cyp3a5 or cyp3a7. common metabolites included 6β-hydroxylation and δ(6)-dehydrogenation for triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and flunisolide. the structure of δ(6)-flunisolide was unambiguously established by nmr analysis. metabolism also occurred on the d-ring substituents, including the 21-carboxy metabolites for triamcinolone acetonide and flunisolide. the novel metabolite 21-nortriamcinolone acetonide was also identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nmr analysis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ neuroprotective role of atp-sensitive potassium channels in cerebral ischemia. atp-sensitive potassium (k(atp)) channels are weak, inward rectifiers that couple metabolic status to cell membrane electrical activity, thus modulating many cellular functions. an increase in the adp/atp ratio opens k(atp) channels, leading to membrane hyperpolarization. k(atp) channels are ubiquitously expressed in neurons located in different regions of the brain, including the hippocampus and cortex. brief hypoxia triggers membrane hyperpolarization in these central neurons. in vivo animal studies confirmed that knocking out the kir6.2 subunit of the k(atp) channels increases ischemic infarction, and overexpression of the kir6.2 subunit reduces neuronal injury from ischemic insults. these findings provide the basis for a practical strategy whereby activation of endogenous k(atp) channels reduces cellular damage resulting from cerebral ischemic stroke. k(atp) channel modulators may prove to be clinically useful as part of a combination therapy for stroke management in the future.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ alefacept, an immunomodulatory recombinant lfa-3/igg1 fusion protein, induces cd16 signaling and cd2/cd16-dependent apoptosis of cd2(+) cells. alefacept, an immunomodulatory recombinant fusion protein composed of the first extracellular domain of lfa-3 fused to the human igg1 hinge, c(h)2, and c(h)3 domains, has recently been shown in phase ii and iii clinical trials to safely reduce disease expression in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. alefacept modulates the function of and selectively induces apoptosis of cd2(+) human memory-effector t cells in vivo. we have sought to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of action that influence the biological activity of alefacept and may contribute to its efficacy and patient responsiveness. specifically evaluated is the ability of alefacept to activate intracellular signals mediated via cd2 and/or fc gamma riii (cd16). experimentation using isoforms of alefacept engineered to have amino acid substitutions in the igg1 c(h)2 domain that impact fc gamma r binding indicate that alefacept mediates cognate interactions between cells expressing human cd2 and cd16 to activate cells, e.g., increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, up-regulate cell surface expression of the activation marker cd25, and induce release of granzyme b. in the systems used, this signaling is shown to require binding to cd2 and cd16 and be mediated through cd16, but not cd2. experimentation using human cd2-transgenic mice and isoforms of alefacept confirmed the requirement for fc gamma r binding for detection of the pharmacological effects of alefacept in vivo. thus alefacept acts as an effector molecule, mediating cognate interactions to activate fc gamma r(+) cells (e.g., nk cells) to induce apoptosis of sensitive cd2(+) target cells.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ a role for cargo in the activation of adp-ribosylation factors (arf) and adaptor recruitment. membrane traffic requires the specific concentration of protein cargos and exclusion of other proteins into nascent carriers. critical components of this selectivity are the protein adaptors that bind to short, linear motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane protein cargos and sequester them into nascent carriers. the recruitment of the adaptors is mediated by activated arf gtpases and the arf-adaptor complexes mark sites of carrier formation. however, the nature of the signal(s) that initiate carrier biogenesis remains unknown. we examined the specificity and initial sites of recruitment of arf-dependent adaptors (ap-1 and ggas) in response to the golgi or endosomal localization of specific cargo proteins (furin, mannose-6-phosphate receptor (m6pr) and m6pr lacking a c-terminal domain m6prδc). we find that cargo promotes the recruitment of specific adaptors, suggesting that it is part of an upstream signaling event. cargos do not promote adaptor recruitment to all compartments in which they reside and thus additional factors regulate the cargo's ability to promote arf activation and adaptor recruitment. we document that within a given compartment different cargos recruit different adaptors suggesting that there is little or no free, activated arf at the membrane and that arf activation is spatially and temporally coupled to the cargo and the adaptor. using temperature block, brefeldin a, and recovery from each, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of m6pr causes the recruitment of ap-1 and ggas to recycling endosomes and not at the golgi, as predicted by steady state staining profiles. these results are discussed with respect to the generation of novel models for cargo-dependent regulation of membrane traffic.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ mutation of arginine 228 to lysine enhances the glucosyltransferase activity of bovine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase i. beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase i (beta4gal-t1) normally transfers gal from udp-gal to glcnac in the presence of mn(2+) ion (gal-t activity) and also transfers glc from udp-glc to glcnac (glc-t activity), albeit at only 0.3% efficiency. in addition, alpha-lactalbumin (la) enhances this glc-t activity more than 25 times. comparison of the crystal structures of udp-gal- and udp-glc-bound beta4gal-t1 reveals that the o4 hydroxyl group in both gal and glc moieties forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxylate group of glu317. the orientation of the o4 hydroxyl of glucose causes a steric hindrance to the side chain carboxylate group of glu317, accounting for the enzyme's low glc-t activity. in this study, we show that mutation of arg228, a residue in the vicinity of glu317, to lysine (r228k-gal-t1) results in a 15-fold higher glc-t activity, which is further enhanced by la to nearly 25% of the gal-t activity of the wild type. the kinetic parameters indicate that the main effect of the mutation of arg228 to lysine is on the k(cat) of glc-t, which increases 3-4-fold, both in the absence and in the presence of la; simultaneously, the k(cat) for the gal-t reaction is reduced 30-fold. the crystal structure of r228k-gal-t1 complexed with la, udp-gal, and mn(2+) determined at 1.9 a resolution shows that the asp318 side chain exhibits a minor alternate conformation, compared to that in the wild type. this alternate conformation now causes a steric hindrance to the o4 hydroxyl group of the gal moiety of udp-gal, probably causing the dissociation of udp-gal and the reduced k(cat) of the gal-t reaction.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ parental exposure to natural mixtures of pops reduced embryo production and altered gene transcription in zebrafish embryos. determination of toxicity of complex mixtures has been proposed to be one of the most important challenges for modern toxicology. in this study we performed genome wide transcriptome profiling to assess potential toxicant induced changes in gene regulation in zebrafish embryos following parental exposure to two natural mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (pops). the mixtures used were extracted from burbot (lota lota) liver originating from two lakes (lake mjøsa and lake losna) belonging to the same freshwater system in norway. the dominating groups of contaminants were polybrominated diphenyl ethers (pbdes), polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites (ddts). because both mixtures used in the present study induced similar effects, it is likely that the same toxicants are involved. the mjøsa mixture contains high levels of pbdes while this group of pollutants is low in the losna mixture. however, both mixtures contain substantial concentrations of pcb and ddt suggesting these contaminants as the predominant contributors to the toxicity observed. the observed effects included phenotypic traits, like embryo production and survival, and gene transcription changes corresponding with disease and biological functions such as cancer, reproductive system disease, cardiovascular disease, lipid and protein metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and cell cycle. the changes in gene transcription included genes regulated by hnf4a, insulin, lh, fsh and nf-κb which are known to be central regulators of endocrine signaling, metabolism, metabolic homeostasis, immune functions, cancer development and reproduction. the results suggest that relative low concentrations of the natural mixtures of pops used in the present study might pose a threat to wild freshwater fish living in the lakes from which the pops mixtures originated.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ phenolic compounds present in sardinian wine extracts protect against the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by oxysterols in caco-2 human enterocyte-like cells. cholesterol auto-oxidation products, namely oxysterols, are widely present in cholesterol-rich foods. they are thought to potentially interfere with homeostasis of the human digestive tract, playing a role in intestinal mucosal damage. this report concerns the marked up-regulation in differentiated caco-2 colonic epithelial cells of two key inflammatory interleukins, il-6 and il-8, caused by a mixture of oxysterols representative of a high cholesterol diet. this strong pro-inflammatory effect appeared to be dependent on the net imbalance of red-ox equilibrium with the production of excessive levels of reactive oxygen species through the colonic nadph-oxidase nox1 activation. induction of nox1 was markedly while not fully inhibited by caco-2 cell pre-incubation with phenolic extracts obtained from well-selected wines from typical grape varieties grown in sardinia. oxysterol-dependent nox1 activation, as well as interleukin synthesis, were completely prevented by cannonau red wine extract that contains an abundant phenolic fraction, in particular phenolic acids and flavonoids. conversely, cell pre-treatment with vermentino white wine extract with smaller phenolic fraction showed only a partial nox1 down-regulation and was ineffective in interleukin synthesis induced by dietary oxysterols. it is thus likely that the effects of sardinian wine extracts against intestinal inflammation induced by dietary oxysterols are mainly due to their high phenolic content: low doses of phenolics would be responsible only for direct scavenging oxysterol-dependent ros production. besides this direct activity, an excess of phenolic compounds detectable in red wine, may exert an additional indirect action by blocking oxysterol-related nox1 induction, thus totally preventing the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory events triggered by dietary oxysterols.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ nicotine facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning. perceptual learning is a special type of non-declarative learning that involves experience-dependent plasticity in sensory cortices. the cholinergic system is known to modulate declarative learning. in particular, reduced levels or efficacy of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine were found to facilitate declarative memory consolidation. however, little is known about the role of the cholinergic system in memory consolidation of non-declarative learning. here we compared two groups of non-smoking men who learned a visual texture discrimination task (tdt). one group received chewing tobacco containing nicotine for 1 h directly following the tdt training. the other group received a similar tasting control substance without nicotine. electroencephalographic recordings during substance consumption showed reduced alpha activity and p300 latencies in the nicotine group compared to the control group. when re-tested on the tdt the following day, both groups responded more accurately and more rapidly than during training. these improvements were specific to the retinal location and orientation of the texture elements of the tdt suggesting that learning involved early visual cortex. a group comparison showed that learning effects were more pronounced in the nicotine group than in the control group. these findings suggest that oral consumption of nicotine enhances the efficacy of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. our findings further suggest that enhanced efficacy of the cholinergic system facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning (and possibly other types of non-declarative learning). in that regard acetylcholine seems to affect consolidation processes in perceptual learning in a different manner than in declarative learning. alternatively, our findings might reflect dose-dependent cholinergic modulation of memory consolidation. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'cognitive enhancers'.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ membranar effects exerted in vitro by polyphenols - quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and curcumin - on huvec and jurkat cells, relevant for diabetes mellitus. polyphenols are largely studied for their beneficial action in various pathologies, but the correlation with their effects on cell membranes is still elusive. in the present study we assessed the effects exerted in vitro by quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and curcumin on membrane fluidity and transmembrane potential of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and jurkat t lymphoblasts, in experimental conditions mimicking diabetes mellitus, i.e. high glucose conditions or increased concentration of advanced glycation end products. results showed that the investigated polyphenols had beneficial effects on cell membranes altered in diabetic conditions, by restoring transmembrane potential and by membrane "stiffening". moreover, they limited the release of pro-inflammatory factors, like monocyte chemotactic protein-1. these effects were more obvious for cells exposed to advanced glycation end products specific for the late stages of diabetes. apparently, the inhibitory action of polyphenols on lipid peroxidation was associated with a decrease of membrane fluidity. concluding, our in vitro study highlighted the potential beneficial action of polyphenols mainly in the late stages of diabetes, exerted at the level of membrane fluidity and transmembrane potential, accompanied by an anti-inflammatory effect on endothelial and immune cells.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ immunohistochemical characterization of pyrimidine synthetic enzymes, thymidine kinase-1 and thymidylate synthase, in various types of cancer. thymidine kinase-1 (tk-1) and thymidylate synthase (ts) are key enzymes for salvage and de novo pyrimidine synthesis, respectively. numerous studies have suggested that increased ts levels are associated closely with resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. tas-102 is a novel drug containing trifluorothymidine, which is phosphorylated by tk-1 to its active monophosphated form, that in turn can inhibit ts. tas-102 has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidine-resistant human cancer cells. tas-102 is currently undergoing clinical trials for use in gastrointestinal cancers. in the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of tk-1 and ts in various types of cancer. tk-1 and ts expression was markedly different between cancer types. high tk-1 expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas. gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and squamous cell uterine carcinomas were often accompanied by high ts expression, indicating activation of pyrimidine synthesis through both the salvage and de novo pathways. these results led us to consider that tas-102 may also be effective for esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidine-resistant cases with high ts expression. in contrast, thyroid papillary carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, which exhibit low tk-1 expression, may be resistant to tas-102. in non-small cell lung cancers, high tk-1 expression was demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas. this result suggests that tas-102 efficacy and the pyrimidine synthetic pathway may differ depending on histological type. our results indicate that administration of tas-102 could be selected on the basis of the immunohistochemical evaluation of tk-1 and ts.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

[6]-gingerol derived from zingiber officinale roscoe (ginger) was identified as a novel angiotensin ii type 1 receptor antagonist, with an ic50 value of 8.173 µm. the hit was further tested by a specificity assay indicating that it had no antagonistic effects on other evaluated gpcrs, such as endothelin receptors. the major ingredient of ginger, [6]-gingerol, could inhibit angiotensin ii type 1 receptor activation, which partially clarified the mechanism of ginger regulating blood pressure and strengthening heart in the cardiovascular system.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ fisetin regulates obesity by targeting mtorc1 signaling. fisetin, a flavonol present in vegetables and fruits, possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. in this study, we have demonstrated that fisetin prevents diet-induced obesity through regulation of the signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), a central mediator of cellular growth, cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesis. to evaluate whether fisetin regulates mtorc1 signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the 70-kda ribosomal protein s6 kinase 1 (s6k1) and mtorc1 in 3t3-l1 preadipocytes. fisetin treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of s6k1 and mtorc1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. to further our understanding of how fisetin negatively regulates mtorc1 signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of s6k1, mtor and akt in fisetin-treated tsc2-knockdown cells. the results suggested that fisetin treatment inhibits mtorc1 activity in an akt-dependent manner. recent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on mtorc1 activity. fisetin treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the negative effect of fisetin on mtor. the inhibitory effect of fisetin on adipogenesis is dependent of mtor activity, suggesting that fisetin inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides during adipocyte differentiation by targeting mtorc1 signaling. fisetin supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet (hfd) significantly attenuated hfd-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue. we also observed that fisetin efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of akt, s6k1 and mtorc1 in adipose tissue. collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of mtorc1 signaling by fisetin prevents adipocyte differentiation of 3t3-l1 preadipocytes and obesity in hfd-fed mice. therefore, fisetin may be a useful phytochemical agent for attenuating diet-induced obesity.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ withdrawal from free-choice ethanol consumption results in increased packing density of glutamine synthetase-immunoreactive astrocytes in the prelimbic cortex of alcohol-preferring rats. excess activation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the cerebral cortex following ethanol withdrawal is considered to contribute to significant behavioural disturbances, and to alcohol craving. astrocytes may play a role in these manifestations because astrocytes are essential in the regulation of released glutamate and its conversion to glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (gs). however, it is unclear if withdrawal from free-choice ethanol drinking causes changes in the numbers of astrocytes expressing gs or the cytoskeletal protein of astrocytes glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap). alcohol-preferring (p) rats exposed to free-choice ethanol drinking were either maintained without forced interruption of ethanol drinking, subjected to a 3-day withdrawal period at the end of 2 months, or subjected to three 3-day withdrawal periods along 6 months. at 2 months, p rats were also compared with alcohol-naive alcohol non-preferring rats (np) rats. packing density of gs and gfap-immunoreactive (ir) astrocytes was measured in sections from the prelimbic cortex (plc) using the optical disector probe. an alcohol deprivation effect was observed in p rats with withdrawals during a 6-month ethanol drinking period. ethanol withdrawal significantly increased the packing density of gs- and gfap-ir astrocytes in the plc of p rats as compared with p rats with continuous access to ethanol. in addition, there was a positive correlation between the pre-withdrawal ethanol consumption and the packing density of gs-ir astrocytes. the present results suggest the involvement of astrocytes in the regulation of the glutamatergic activation associated with withdrawal from free-choice ethanol consumption and point to differential adaptations of gs and gfap to prolonged alcohol drinking in the plc of p rats.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ streptococcus pneumoniae clpp protease induces apoptosis via caspase-independent pathway in human neuroblastoma cells: cytoplasmic relocalization of p53. streptococcus pneumoniae causes the most severe form of the bacterial meningitis which is the major cause of bacterial meningitis. virulence factors produced by s. pneumoniae have been known to contribute significantly to the disease process. clpp protease (clpp) which is essential for virulence and survival under stress conditions in s. pneumonia was examined for the ability to induce apoptosis and the mechanism of the induction of apoptosis in human neuron-like cells, sk-n-sh neuroblastoma cells. clpp inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in sk-n-sh cells. treatment with clpp resulted in hypodiploid dna contents, increased bax/ bcl-2 ratio and induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) production. the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, which is an initiator of the activation of caspase cascades, was not observed in clpp-treated cells. in addition, pretreatment with z-val-ala-asp-fluoromethylketone (z-vad-fmk), a broad spectrum of caspase inhibitor, could not rescue apoptotic cells from clpp toxicity. coincidently, caspase-3 and -8 activation and cleavage of parp were not detected. moreover, caspase independent apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) was released from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus in response to clpp. we also found that clpp treatment resulted in the increase of p53 activity and cytoplasmic p53 levels were increased by clpp, suggesting that functional activation of p53 is intact despite increased cytoplasmic accumulation. taken together, these data suggest that clpp contributes to neuronal damage in meningitis and provide further insight into the mechanisms underlying action of pneumococcal virulence factors during bacterial pathogenesis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ novel therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer. oncogenic driver mutations frequently occur in lung cancer and play role in carcinogenesis. these mutations are usually associated with distinct clinical and histological features and are attractive targets for anticancer therapy. recently, several molecularly distinct phenotypes of nsclc based on specific and mutually exclusive genetic derangements have been described. few targets like epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk) gene rearrangements have successfully been targeted with egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) and crizotinib, respectively. many more inhibitors of specific driver mutations involving genes like ros, c-met, fgfr, mtor, igfr and ret are currently under development. however, efforts to target some mutated genes like k-ras have been unsuccessful. moreover, the emerging challenge of acquired resistance to initially effective therapy is becoming another major concern. in this review recent data on novel molecular targets and their future prospects are discussed.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ norepinephrine transporters have channel modes of conduction. neurotransmitter transporters couple to existing ion gradients to achieve reuptake of transmitter into presynaptic terminals. for coupled cotransport, substrates and ions cross the membrane in fixed stoichiometry. this is in contrast to ion channels, which carry an arbitrary number of ions depending on the channel open time. members of the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter gene family presumably function with fixed stoichiometry in which a set number of ions cotransport with one transmitter molecule. here we report channel-like events from a presumably fixed stoichiometry [norepinephrine (ne)+, na+, and cl-], human ne (hnet) in the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter gene family. these events are stimulated by ne and by guanethidine, an hnet substrate, and they are blocked by cocaine and the antidepressant desipramine. voltage-clamp data combined with ne uptake data from these same cells indicate that hnets have two functional modes of conduction: a classical transporter mode (t-mode) and a novel channel mode (c-mode). both t-mode and c-mode are gated by the same substrates and antagonized by the same blockers. t-mode is putatively electrogenic because the transmitter and cotransported ions sum to one net charge. however, c-mode carries virtually all of the transmitter-induced current, even though it occurs with low probability. this is because each c-mode opening transports hundreds of charges per event. the existence of a channel mode of conduction in a previously established fixed-stoichiometry transporter suggests the appearance of an aqueous pore through the transporter protein during the transport cycle and may have significance for transporter regulation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ acyl-coa synthetase isoforms 1, 4, and 5 are present in different subcellular membranes in rat liver and can be inhibited independently. inhibition studies have suggested that acyl-coa synthetase (acs, ec ) isoforms might regulate the use of acyl-coas by different metabolic pathways. in order to determine whether the subcellular locations differed for each of the three acss present in liver and whether these isoforms were regulated independently, non-cross-reacting peptide antibodies were raised against acs1, acs4, and acs5. acs1 was identified in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria-associated membrane (mam), and cytosol, but not in mitochondria. acs4 was present primarily in mam, and the 76-kda acs5 protein was located in mitochondrial membrane. consistent with these locations, n-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of acs4, inhibited acs activity 47% in mam and 28% in endoplasmic reticulum. troglitazone, a second acs4 inhibitor, inhibited acs activity <10% in microsomes and mitochondria and 45% in mam. triacsin c, a competitive inhibitor of both acs1 and acs4, inhibited acs activity similarly in endoplasmic reticulum, mam, and mitochondria, suggesting that a hitherto unidentified triacsin-sensitive acs is present in mitochondria. acs1, acs4, and acs5 were regulated independently by fasting and re-feeding. fasting rats for 48 h resulted in a decrease in acs4 protein, and an increase in acs5. re-feeding normal chow or a high sucrose diet for 24 h after a 48-h fast increased both acs1 and acs4 protein expression 1.5-2.0-fold, consistent with inhibition studies. these results suggest that acs1 and acs4 may be linked to triacylglycerol synthesis. taken together, the data suggest that acyl-coas may be functionally channeled to specific metabolic pathways through different acs isoforms in unique subcellular locations.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ l-bmaa induced er stress and enhanced caspase 12 cleavage in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells at low nonexcitotoxic concentrations. the cyanobacterial β-n-methylamino-l-alanine (l-bmaa) is described as a low-potency excitotoxin, possibly a factor in the increased incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and parkinsonism-dementia complex (pdc) in guam. the latter association is intensively disputed, as l-bmaa concentrations required for toxic effects exceed those assumed to occur via food. the question thus was raised whether l-bmaa leads to neurodegeneration at nonexcitotoxic conditions. using human sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells, l-bmaa-transport, incorporation into proteins, and subsequent impairment of cellular protein homeostasis were investigated. binding of l-bmaa to intracellular proteins, but no clear protein incorporation was detected in response to (14)c-l-bmaa exposures. nevertheless, low l-bmaa concentrations (≥ 0.1mm, 48 h) increased protein ubiquitination, 20s proteasomal and caspase 12 activity, expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress marker chop, and enhanced phosphorylation of elf2α in sh-sy5y cells. in contrast, high l-bmaa concentrations (≥ 1mm, 48 h) increased reactive oxygen species and protein oxidization, which were partially ameliorated by coincubation with vitamin e. l-bmaa-mediated cytotoxicity was observable 48 h following ≥ 2mm l-bmaa treatment. consequently, the data presented here suggest that low l-bmaa concentrations result in a dysregulation of the cellular protein homeostasis with ensuing er stress that is independent from high-concentration effects such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. thus, the latter could be a contributing factor in the onset and slow progression of als/pdc in guam.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(2004) j. biol. chem. 279, 13095-13101]. present results of point mutations of full-length pde5 showed that maximum catalysis was decreased 2650-fold in h613a and 55-fold in f820a. catalytic-site affinities for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (ibmx) were respectively weakened 14-, 123-, 30-, 51-, and 43-fold for y612a; 63-, 511-, 43-, 95- and 61-fold for q817a; and 59-, 448-, 71-, 137-, and 93-fold for f820a. the data indicate that these three amino acids are major determinants of affinity for cgmp and potency of selective and nonselective inhibitors, and that higher vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil results from stronger contacts with tyr-612, gln-817, and phe-820. affinity of v782a for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or ibmx was reduced 5.5-, 23-, 10-, 3-, and 12-fold, respectively. change in affinity for cgmp, vardenafil, sildenafil, or ibmx in y612f, h613a, l765a, or f786a was less, but affinity of h613a or f786a for tadalafil was weakened 37- and 17-fold, respectively. the results quantify the role of pde5 catalytic-site residues for cgmp and inhibitors, indicate that tyr-612, gln-817, and phe-820 are the most important cgmp or inhibitor contacts studied, and identify residues that contribute to selectivity among different classes of inhibitors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the potential of nicotinic enhancement of cognitive remediation training in schizophrenia. cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are critically important predictors of long-term psychosocial outcome and are not significantly ameliorated by currently available medications. cognitive remediation training has shown promise for alleviating cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, but the clinical significance has often been limited by small effect sizes. approaches that achieve larger improvement involve time requirements that can be cost-prohibitive within the current clinical care system. this mini-review evaluates the theoretical potential of a pharmacological enhancement strategy of cognitive remediation training with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) agonists. nachr agonists can facilitate sensory processing, alertness, attention, learning and memory. while these effects may be too subtle and short-lasting to be of clinical relevance as a primary treatment of cognitive deficits, they constitute an ideal effects profile for enhancing training benefits. several mechanisms are described through which repeated coupling of cognitive training challenges with nachr stimulation may enhance and accelerate cognitive remediation training effects, advancing such interventions into more effective and practicable treatments of some of the most debilitating symptoms of schizophrenia. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'cognitive enhancers'.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ universal rule on chirality-dependent bandgaps in graphene antidot lattices. graphene with periodically patterned antidots has attracted intense research attention as it represents a facile route to open a bandgap for graphene electronics. however, not all graphene antidot lattices (gals) can open a bandgap and a guiding rule is missing. here, through systematic first-principles calculations, it is found that bandgaps in triangular gals are surprisingly well defined by a chirality vector r = n a1 + ma2 connecting two neighboring antidots, where a1 and a2 are the basis vectors of graphene. the bandgap opens in the gals with (n-m)mod3 = 0 but remains closed in those with (n-m)mod3 = ±1, reminiscent of the gap-chirality rule in carbon nanotubes. remarkably, the gap value in gals allows ample modulation by adjusting the length of chirality vectors, shape and size of the antidots. the gap-chirality relation in gals stems from the chirality-dependent atomic structures of gals as revealed by a super-atom model as well as clar sextet analyses. this chirality-dependent bandgap is further shown to be a generic behavior in any parallelogram gal and thus serves as an essential stepping stone for experimenters to realize graphene devices by antidot engineering.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ arsenic activates endothelin-1 gi protein-coupled receptor signaling to inhibit stem cell differentiation in adipogenesis. dysfunctional lipid and glucose metabolism contribute to metabolic syndrome-a major public health concern that enhances cardiovascular disease risk. arsenic (as(iii)) exposure may increase metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk by impairing adipose tissue differentiation, function, and insulin sensitivity through pathogenic mechanisms that remain unclear. we hypothesized that as(iii) signals through the pertussis toxin (ptx) sensitive, gi protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) to impair adipogenesis, as previously demonstrated for its stimulation of vascular oxidant generation, angiogenesis, and remodeling. because both as(iii) and gpcr ligands inhibit progenitor cell differentiation into adipocytes, we investigated the hypothesis in a model of low-passage human mesenchymal stem cells (hmsc). as(iii) (0.1-1.0 µm) suppressed dexamethasone/insulin-induced hmsc adipogenesis, as indicated by decreased transcriptional promoters of differentiation, decreased fat droplet formation, and decreased expression of differentiated adipocyte markers, such as adiponectin and perilipin. preincubating hmsc with ptx prevented 90% of the suppressive effect of as(iii). selective competitive antagonists of gi-coupled endothelin-1 type a and b receptors were ~60% effective in blocking as(iii) inhibition and combination of antagonists to both receptors were 85% effective. in contrast, antagonists to the sphingosine-1-phosphate type 1 receptor (previously shown to mediate as(iii) vascular effects) or the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor were ineffective in blocking as(iii) effects. these studies suggest a majority of arsenic-inhibited adipocyte differentiation, and metabolism requires endothelin-1 gpcrs and that as(iii) effects on gpcr signaling are tissue and context specific. this may represent a significant mechanism for the contribution of arsenic exposure to increased metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

[3h]-spiperone competition binding assays showed that a-381393 potently bound to membrane from cells expressing recombinant human dopamine d4.4 receptor (ki=1.5 nm), which was 20-fold higher than that of clozapine (ki=30.4 nm). a-381393 exhibited highly selective binding for the dopamine d4.4 receptor (>2700-fold) when compared to d1, d2, d3 and d5 dopamine receptors. furthermore, in comparison to clozapine and l-745870, a-381393 exhibits better receptor selectivity, showing no affinity up to 10 microm for a panel of more than 70 receptors and channels, with the exception of moderate affinity for 5-ht2a (ki=370 nm). a-381393 potently inhibited the functional activity of agonist-induced gtp-gamma-s binding assay and 1 microm dopamine induced-ca2+ flux in human dopamine d4.4 receptor expressing cells, but not in human dopamine d2l or d3 receptor cells. in contrast to l-745870, a-381393 did not exhibit any significant intrinsic activity in a d4.4 receptor. in vivo, a-381393 has good brain penetration after subcutaneous administration. a-381393 inhibited penile erection induced by the selective d4 agonist pd168077 in conscious rats. thus, a-381393 is a novel selective d4 antagonist that will enhance the ability to study dopamine d4 receptors both in vitro and in vivo.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(177)lu-dota-ggnle-cycmshhex showed high tumor to normal organ uptake ratios except for the kidneys. the tumor/kidney uptake ratios of (177)lu-dota-ggnle-cycmshhex were 2.76 and 1.74 at 2 and 24h post-injection. the melanoma lesions were clearly visualized by spect/ct using (177)lu-dota-ggnle-cycmshhex as an imaging probe at 2h post-injection. overall, high melanoma uptake coupled with fast urinary clearance of (177)lu-dota-ggnle-cycmshhex underscored its potential for melanoma treatment in the future.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ beta-glucogallin reduces the expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory markers by inhibition of aldose reductase in murine macrophages and ocular tissues. aldose reductase (ar) catalyzes the reduction of toxic lipid aldehydes to their alcohol products and mediates inflammatory signals triggered by lipopolysaccharide (lps). beta-glucogallin (bgg), a recently described ar inhibitor, was purified from extracts of the indian gooseberry (emblica officinalis). in this study, we found that bgg showed low cytotoxicity in raw264.7 murine macrophages and effectively inhibited ar activity as measured by a decrease in sorbitol accumulation. in addition, bgg-mediated inhibition of ar prevented lps-induced activation of jnk and p38 and lowered ros levels, which could inhibit lps-induced apoptosis. uveitis is a disease of the eye associated with chronic inflammation. in this study, we also demonstrated that treatment with bgg decreased the number of inflammatory cells that infiltrate the ocular media of mice with experimental uveitis. accordingly, these results suggest bgg is a potential therapy for inflammatory diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ fumarate reductase is essential for helicobacter pylori colonization of the mouse stomach. fumarate reductase (frd) is the key enzyme in fumarate respiration induced by anaerobic growth of bacteria. in helicobacter pylori, this enzyme appears to be constitutively expressed under microaerobic conditions and is not essential for its survival in vitro. in this study, the role of frd in the colonization of h. pylori was investigated using a mouse model. the frda gene coding for subunit a of frd, and two control genes, copa and copp associated with the export of copper out of h. pylori, were inactivated by insertion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette into these individual genes. the isogenic mutants of h. pylori strain ah244 were obtained by natural transformation. seventy-five icr mice (15 mice/group) were orogastrically dosed with either the wild type h. pylori strain ah244, its isogenic mutants, or brucella broth (negative control). five mice from each group were killed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-inoculation (wpi), respectively. h. pylori colonization was not detected in mouse gastric mucosa infected with the frda mutant at any time point in the study by both quantitative culture and pcr. in contrast, the mice inoculated with either wild type ah244, copa or copph. pylori mutants became readily infected. these data indicate that frd plays a crucial role in h. pylori survival in the gastric mucosa of mice. given that frd, present in all h. pylori strains, is immunogenic in h. pylori -infected patients and h. pylori growth in vitro can be inhibited by three anthelmintics (morantel, oxantel and thiabendazole), this enzyme could potentially be used both as a novel drug target as well as in the development of vaccines for h. pylori prevention and eradication.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ trace amine-associated receptor 1 displays species-dependent stereoselectivity for isomers of methamphetamine, amphetamine, and para-hydroxyamphetamine. the synthetic amines methamphetamine (meth), amphetamine (amph), and their metabolite para-hydroxyamphetamine (poha) are chemically and structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters and a small group of endogenous biogenic amines collectively referred to as the trace amines (tas). recently, it was reported that meth, amph, poha, and the tas para-tyramine (tyr) and beta-phenylethylamine (pea) stimulate camp production in human embryonic kidney (hek)-293 cells expressing rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (rtaar1). the discovery that meth and amph activate the rtaar1 motivated us to study the effect of these drugs on the mouse taar1 (mtaar1) and a human-rat chimera (hrchtaar1). furthermore, because s-(+)-isomers of meth and amph are reported to be more potent and efficacious in vivo than r-(-), we determined the enantiomeric selectivity of all three species of taar1. in response to meth, amph, or poha exposure, the accumulation of camp by hek-293 cells stably expressing different species of taar1 was concentration- and isomer-dependent. ec50 values for s-(+)-meth were 0.89, 0.92, and 4.44 microm for rtaar1, mtaar1, and h-rchtaar1, respectively. pea was a potent and full agonist at each species of taar1, whereas tyr was a full agonist for the rodent taar1s but was a partial agonist at h-rchtaar1. interestingly, both isomers of meth were full agonists at mtaar1 and h-rchtaar1, whereas both were partial agonists at rtaar1. taken together, these in vitro results suggest that, in vivo, taar1 could be a novel mediator of the effects of these drugs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ autophagy takes place in mutated p53 neuroblastoma cells in response to hypoxia mimetic cocl(2). solid tumors like neuroblastoma exhibit hypoxic areas, which can lead both to cell death or aggressiveness increase. hypoxia is a known stress able to induce stabilization of p53, implicated in cell fate regulation. recently, p53 appeared to be involved in autophagy in an opposite manner, depending on its location: when nuclear, it enhanced transcription of pro-autophagic genes whereas when cytoplasmic, it inhibited the autophagic process. today, we used cobalt chloride, a hypoxia mimetic that inhibits proteasomal hif-1 degradation and generates reactive oxygen species (ros). we focused on cocl2-induced cell death in a dna-binding mutated p53 neuroblastoma cell line (sknbe(2c)). an autophagic signaling was evidenced by an increase of beclin-1, atg 5-12, and lc3-ii expression whereas the p53(mut) presence decreased with cocl2 time exposure. activation of the pathway seemed to protect cells from ros production and, at least in part, from death. the autophagic inhibitors activated the apoptotic signaling and the death was enhanced. to delineate the eventual implication of the p53(mut) in the autophagic process in response to hypoxia, we monitored signaling in p53(wt)shsy5y cells, after either shrna-p53 down-regulation or transcriptional activity inhibition by pifithrin alpha. we did not detect autophagy neither with p53(wt) nor when p53 was lacking whereas such a response was effective with a mutated or inactivated p53. to conclude, mutated p53 in neuroblastoma cells could be linked with the switch between apoptotic response and cell death by autophagy in response to hypoxic mimetic stress.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ ica-105574 interacts with a common binding site to elicit opposite effects on inactivation gating of eag and erg potassium channels. rapid and voltage-dependent inactivation greatly attenuates outward currents in ether-a-go-go-related gene (erg) k(+) channels. in contrast, inactivation of related ether-a-go-go (eag) k(+) channels is very slow and minimally reduces outward currents. ica-105574 (ica, or 3-nitro-n-[4-phenoxyphenyl]-benzamide) has opposite effects on inactivation of these two channel types. although ica greatly attenuates erg inactivation by shifting its voltage dependence to more positive potentials, it enhances the rate and extent of eag inactivation without altering its voltage dependence. here, we investigate whether the inverse functional response to ica in eag and erg channels is related to differences in ica binding site or to intrinsic mechanisms of inactivation. molecular modeling coupled with site-directed mutagenesis suggests that ica binds in a channel-specific orientation to a hydrophobic pocket bounded by the s5/pore helix/s6 of one subunit and s6 of an adjacent subunit. ica is a mixed agonist of mutant eag and eag/erg chimera channels that inactivate by a combination of slow and fast mechanisms. with the exception of three residues, the specific amino acids that form the putative binding pocket for ica in erg are conserved in eag. mutations introduced into eag to replicate the ica binding site in erg did not alter the functional response to ica. together these findings suggest that ica binds to the same site in eag and erg channels to elicit opposite functional effects. the resultant agonist or antagonist activity is determined solely by channel-specific differences in the mechanisms of inactivation gating.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ toxicity profile of small-molecule iap antagonist gdc-0152 is linked to tnf-α pharmacology. inhibitor-of-apoptosis (iap) proteins suppress apoptosis and are overexpressed in a variety of cancers. small-molecule iap antagonists are currently being tested in clinical trials as novel cancer therapeutics. gdc-0152 is a small-molecule drug that triggers tumor cell apoptosis by selectively antagonizing iaps. gdc-0152 induces nf-κb transcriptional activity leading to expression of several chemokines and cytokines, of which tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) is the most important for single-agent tumor activity. tnf-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that drives a variety of cellular responses, comprising inflammation, proliferation, and cell survival or death depending on the cellular context. as malignant and normal cells produce tnf-α upon iap antagonism, increased tnf-α could drive both efficacy and toxicity. the toxicity profile of gdc-0152 in dogs and rats was characterized after iv dose administration once every 2 weeks for four doses. findings in both species consisted of a dose-related, acute, systemic inflammatory response, and hepatic injury. laboratory findings included elevated plasma cytokines, an inflammatory leukogram, and increased liver transaminases with histopathological findings of inflammatory infiltrates and apoptosis/necrosis in multiple tissues; a toxicology profile consistent with tnf-α-mediated toxicity. dogs exhibited more severe findings than rats, and humans did not exhibit these findings, at comparable exposures across species. furthermore, elevations in blood neutrophil count, serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and other markers of inflammation corresponded to gdc-0152 exposure and toxicity and thus may have utility as safety biomarkers.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ manganese-induced oxidative dna damage in neuronal sh-sy5y cells: attenuation of thymine base lesions by glutathione and n-acetylcysteine. manganese (mn) is an essential trace element required for normal function and development. however, exposure to this metal at elevated levels may cause manganism, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with neurological symptoms similar to idiopathic parkinson's disease (ipd). elevated body burdens of mn from exposure to parental nutrition, vapors in mines and smelters and welding fumes have been associated with neurological health concerns. the underlying mechanism of mn neurotoxicity remains unclear. accordingly, the present study was designed to investigate the toxic effects of mn(2+) in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells. mn(2+) caused a concentration dependent decrease in sh-sy5y cellular viability compared to controls. the ld50 value was 12.98 μm mn(2+) (p<0.001 for control vs. 24h mn treatment). both tunel and annexin v/propidium iodide (pi) apoptosis assays confirmed the induction of apoptosis in the cells following exposure to mn(2+) (2 μm, 62 μm or 125 μm). in addition, mn(2+) induced both the formation and accumulation of dna single strand breaks (via alkaline comet assay analysis) and oxidatively modified thymine bases (via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis). pre-incubation of the cells with characteristic antioxidants, either 1mm n-acetylcysteine (nac) or 1mm glutathione (gsh) reduced the level of dna strand breaks and the formation of thymine base lesions, suggesting protection against oxidative cellular damage. our findings indicate that (1) exposure of sh-sy5y cells to mn promotes both the formation and accumulation of oxidative dna damage, (2) sh-sy5y cells with accumulated dna damage are more likely to die via an apoptotic pathway and (3) the accumulated levels of dna damage can be abrogated by the addition of exogenous chemical antioxidants. this is the first known report of mn(2+)-induction and antioxidant protection of thymine lesions in this sh-sy5y cell line and contributes new information to the potential use of antioxidants as a therapeutic strategy for protection against mn(2+)-induced oxidative dna damage.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ regions on adenylyl cyclase vii required for selective regulation by the g13 pathway. regulation of multiple adenylyl cyclases (ac) provides unique inputs to mediate the synthesis of camp, a ubiquitous second messenger that controls many aspects of cellular function. on stimulation by g(s), the activities of acs can be further selectively modulated by other pathways to ensure precise control of intracellular camp responses to specific stimuli. recently, we reported that one of the ac isoforms, ac7, is uniquely regulated by the g(13) pathway. to understand more fully the molecular mechanism of this regulation, we compared the regulation of ac7 with that of ac2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages devoid of ac7. although both enzymes could fully restore regulation of camp by gβγ, activation of the g(13) pathway preferentially synergized with ac7. exchange of domains between the two isoforms indicates that the c1b domain and the n-terminus of the c1a domain are important for directing selective regulation of ac7 by the g(13) pathway. a mutagenesis screen identified more specific regions of ac7 that differentially mediate its regulation by distinct pathways.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ lessons from the dissection of the activation functions (af-1 and af-2) of the estrogen receptor alpha in vivo. estrogens influence most of the physiological processes in mammals, including but not limited to reproduction, cognition, behavior, vascular system, metabolism and bone integrity. given this widespread role for estrogen in human physiology, it is not surprising that estrogen influence the pathophysiology of numerous diseases, including cancer (of the reproductive tract as breast, endometrial but also colorectal, prostate,…), as well as neurodegenerative, inflammatory-immune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and osteoporosis. these actions are mediated by the activation of estrogen receptors (er) alpha (erα) and beta (erβ), which regulate target gene transcription (genomic action) through two independent activation functions (af)-1 and af-2, but can also elicit rapid membrane initiated steroid signals (miss). targeted er gene inactivation has shown that although erβ plays an important role in the central nervous system and in the heart, erα appears to play a prominent role in most of the other tissues. pharmacological activation or inhibition of erα and/or erβ provides already the basis for many therapeutic interventions, from hormone replacement at menopause to prevention of the recurrence of breast cancer. however, the use of these estrogens or selective estrogen receptors modulators (serms) have also induced undesired effects. thus, an important challenge consists now to uncouple the beneficial actions from other deleterious ones. the in vivo molecular "dissection" of erα represents both a molecular and integrated approach that already allowed to delineate in mouse the role of the main "subfunctions" of the receptor and that could pave the way to an optimization of the er modulation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ lapatinib: a dual inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. background: lapatinib, the first dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) tyrosine kinases, was approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) in 2007. it is indicated for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer (mbc) whose tumors overexpress her2 (erbb2) and who have received previous treatment that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab. objective: this review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of lapatinib, and its current and potential role in the treatment of breast cancer and other malignancies. methods: relevant english-language publications were identified through searches of medline (1966-may 2008),the american society of clinical oncology abstracts database (2000-2007), abstracts from the san antonio breast cancer symposium (2005-2007), and the fda web site (january 2008). search terms included lapatinib, gw572016, her2, egfr, receptor tyrosine kinase, dual-receptor blockade, adverse events, and clinical trials. results: the t(max) of lapatinib after oral administration is 3 to 4 hours. dividing the dose or administering it with food, particularly a high-fat meal, increases the auc >2-fold. lapatinib is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome p450 3a4 isozyme, with 1 metabolite remaining active against egfr but not her2. due to drug accumulation, the t(1/2) of lapatinib is 24 hours with continuous dosing. in a phase iii trial comparing lapatinib and capecitabine with capecitabine alone in women with her2-positive, locally advanced breast cancer or mbc that had progressed after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab, the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine was associated with a numeric improvement in response rate compared with capecitabine alone (22% vs 14%, respectively; p = ns) and a significant increase in time to progression (6.2 vs 4.3 months; hazard ratio = 0.57; 95% ci, 0.43-0.77; p < 0.001). lapatinib has been reported to have antitumor activity in phase ii trials when used as first-line therapy for mbc, in patients with inflammatory breast cancer, and in patients with central nervous system metastases. phase ii trials in other solid tumor types found modest activity. the approved dosing of lapatinib is 1,250 mg po qd given continuously in combination with capecitabine 2,000 mg/m(2) daily administered in 2 divided doses on days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle. the most common clinical toxicities of all grades associated with lapatinib used in combination with capecitabine in the pivotal clinical trial were diarrhea (65%), hand-foot syndrome (53%), nausea (44%), rash (29%), and fatigue (24%). cardiac toxicity appears to be less frequent with lapatinib than with trastuzumab. conclusions: lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of the egfr and her2 tyrosine kinases. it is approved by the fda for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of her2-positive mbc that has progressed with standard treatment. in clinical trials, this combination was associated with a significant improvement in the time to progression in patients with mbc. lapatinib's efficacy in other malignancies that overexpress egfr and/or her2 is under evaluation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ quinone compounds regulate the level of ros production by the nadph oxidase nox4. nadph oxidase nox4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and plays a role in cellular signaling by providing reactive oxygen species (ros) as intracellular messengers. nox4 oxidase activity is thought to be constitutive and regulated at the transcriptional level; however, we challenge this point of view and suggest that specific quinone derivatives could modulate this activity. in fact, we demonstrated a significant stimulation of nox4 activity by 4 quinone derivatives (aa-861, tbubhq, tbubq, and duroquinone) observed in 3 different cellular models, hek293e, t-rex™, and chondrocyte cell lines. our results indicate that the effect is specific toward nox4 versus nox2. furthermore, we showed that nad(p)h:quinone oxidoreductase (nqo1) may participate in this stimulation. interestingly, nox4 activity is also stimulated by reducing agents that possibly act by reducing the disulfide bridge (cys226, cys270) located in the extracellular e-loop of nox4. such model of nox4 activity regulation could provide new insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the electron transfer through the enzyme, i.e., its potential redox regulation, and could also define new therapeutic targets in diseases in which quinones and nox4 are implicated.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ fast protein motions are coupled to enzyme h-transfer reactions. coupling of fast protein dynamics to enzyme chemistry is controversial and has ignited considerable debate, especially over the past 15 years in relation to enzyme-catalyzed h-transfer. h-transfer can occur by quantum tunneling, and the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects (kies) has emerged as the "gold standard" descriptor of these reactions. the anomalous temperature dependence of kies is often rationalized by invoking fast motions to facilitate h-transfer, yet crucially, direct evidence for coupled motions is lacking. the fast motions hypothesis underpinning the temperature dependence of kies is based on inference. here, we have perturbed vibrational motions in pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (petnr) by isotopic substitution where all non-exchangeable atoms were replaced with the corresponding heavy isotope ((13)c, (15)n, and (2)h). the kie temperature dependence is perturbed by heavy isotope labeling, demonstrating a direct link between (promoting) vibrations in the protein and the observed kie. further we show that temperature-independent kies do not necessarily rule out a role for fast dynamics coupled to reaction chemistry. we show causality between fast motions and enzyme chemistry and demonstrate how this impacts on experimental kies for enzyme reactions.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan. dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-n-methylmorphinan, dm) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects. the mechanisms of these cns effects of dm have been suggested to be associated with the low-affinity, noncompetitive, n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonism of dm and/or the high-affinity dm/sigma receptors. dm is largely o-demethylated into the phencyclidine (pcp)-like compound dextrorphan (dr), which may limit its therapeutic use by producing pcp-like adverse effects, such as hyperlocomotion. dimemorfan ((+)-3-methyl-n-methylmorphinan, df), an analog of dm, which has been safely used as an antitussive for more than 20 years, is also known not to form dr. this study therefore characterized the binding of df to the sigma receptors and nmda-linked pcp sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of df in mice in comparison with those of dm and dr. we found that df, dm, and dr were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (ki=151, 205, 144 nm, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at sigma-2 receptors (ki=4-11 microm). only dr exhibited moderate affinity for pcp sites (ki=0.9 microm), whereas df (ki=17 microm) and dm (ki=7 microm) were much less active. df, dm and dr produced prominent anticonvulsant effects in mice as measured by the supramaximal electroshock test with comparable potency (ed50 approximately 70 micromol/kg, i.p.). at the tested doses (20-260 micromol/kg, i.p.), dm and dr exhibited biphasic effects on the locomotor activity whereas df produced a consistent dose-dependent decrease. these results revealed that, unlike dm and dr, df did not cause a pcp-like hyperlocomotion adverse effect that is parallel with the pcp sites binding data. furthermore, since they have equipotent anticonvulsant effects and similar binding affinities to sigma-1 receptors, the very low affinity of df at pcp sites may suggest that acting on the pcp sites may not be the requisite for mediating the anticonvulsant activity of these dm analogs. with the history of safety and relative less adverse effects, df appears to be worth further studying on its cns effects other than the antitussive effect.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(-)-pindolol, which possesses significant affinity for 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b, and beta 1/2-adrenergic receptors (ar)s, dose-dependently increased extracellular levels of dopamine (da) and noradrenaline (nad) versus 5-ht, in dialysates of the frontal cortex (fcx), but not accumbens and striatum, of freely-moving rats. in distinction, the preferential beta 1-ar antagonist, betaxolol, and the preferential beta 2-ar antagonist, ici118,551, did not increase basal levels of da, nad, or 5-ht. further, they both dose-dependently and markedly blunted the influence of (-)-pindolol upon da and nad levels. the selective 5-ht1a receptor antagonist, way100,635, slightly attenuated the (-)-pindolol-induced increase in da and nad levels, while the selective 5-ht1b antagonist, sb224,289, was ineffective. these data suggest that (-)-pindolol facilitates frontocortical dopaminergic (and adrenergic) transmission primarily by activation of beta 1/2-ars and, to a lesser degree, by stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors, whereas 5-ht1b receptors are not involved. (-)-pindolol potentiated the increase in fcx levels of 5-ht elicited by the 5-ht reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and duloxetine, and also enhanced their ability to elevate fcx levels of da--though not of nad. in contrast to (-)-pindolol, betaxolol and ici118,551 did not affect the actions of fluoxetine, whereas both way100,635 and sb224,289 potentiated the increase in levels of 5-ht--but not da or nad levels--elicited by fluoxetine. in conclusion, (-)-pindolol modulates, both alone and together with 5-ht reuptake inhibitors, dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic transmission in the fcx via a complex pattern of actions at beta 1/2-ars, 5-ht1a, and 5-ht1b receptors. these findings have important implications for clinical studies of the influence of (-)-pindolol upon the actions of antidepressant agents.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ introduction: the pharmacological profile of eprosartan--implications for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk reduction. moderate elevations in blood pressure translate to significant increases in cardiovascular and cerebro vascular risk. beneficially, this relationship allows small decreases in blood pressure to be associated with risk reduction. both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system are involved in hypertension, hence targeting these systems is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of hypertension. angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers (arbs) are used for controlling blood pressure and treating heart failure in a broad range of patients, including those with diabetes and the elderly. not only have arbs shown good efficacy and tolerability, they also appear to have a protective effect that goes beyond that expected from the reduction of blood pressure. the arb eprosartan is a nonbiphenyl nontetrazole angiotensin ii type 1 receptor (at1) antagonist, which acts to decrease total peripheral resistance. eprosartan acts at vascular at1 receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic at1 receptors, where it inhibits noradrenaline release. in clinical studies, eprosartan has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, whilst avoiding the persistent cough that commonly occurs with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. eprosartan can also be differentiated from other arbs due to its noradrenergic effects, which other arbs used at therapeutic doses do not possess. eprosartan, therefore, represents a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension, including those with a history of stroke or with co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ mechanism of action of dopaminergic agents in parkinson's disease. as the substantia nigra degenerates in parkinson's disease (pd), the nigrostriatal pathway is disrupted, reducing striatal dopamine and producing pd symptoms. although dopamine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, its precursor, levodopa, does. levodopa is absorbed in the small bowel and is rapidly catabolized by aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (aadc) and catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt). because gastric aadc and comt degrade levodopa, the drug is given with inhibitors of aadc (carbidopa or benserazide), and inhibitors of comt will also enter clinical use. although the exact site of decarboxylation of exogenous levodopa to dopamine in the brain is unknown, most striatal aadc is located in nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals. newly synthesized dopamine is stored in the terminals and then released, stimulating postsynaptic dopamine receptors and mediating the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. dopamine agonists act directly on postsynaptic dopamine receptors, thus obviating the need for metabolic conversion, storage, and release. how the actions of dopaminergic drugs produce side effects and how these side effects should be managed are discussed.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

[-]-huperzine a ([-]-hup a), is a naturally occurring potent reversible ache inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. it also has several neuroprotective effects including modification of beta-amyloid peptide, reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and induction and regulation of nerve growth factor. toxicities at higher doses restrict the neuroporotective ability of [-]-hup a for treatment. the synthetic stereoisomer, [+]-hup a, is less toxic due to poor ache inhibition and is suitable for both pre-/post-exposure treatments of nerve agent toxicity. [+]-hup a block the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-induced seizure in rats, reduce excitatory amino acid induced neurotoxicity and also prevent soman induced toxicity with minimum performance decrement. unique combinations of two stereo-isomers of hup a may provide an excellent pre/post-treatment drug for the nerve agent induced seizure/status epilepticus. we investigated a combination of [+]-hup a with a small dose of [-]-hup a ([+] and [-]-hup a) against soman toxicity. our data showed that pretreatment with a combination [+] and [-]-hup a significantly increased the survival rate and reduced behavioral abnormalities after exposure to 1.2×ld50 soman compared to [+]-hup a in guinea pigs. in addition, [+] and [-]-hup a pretreatment inhibited the development of high power of eeg better than [+]-hup a pretreatment alone. these data suggest that a combination of [+] and [-]-hup a offers better protection than [+]-hup a and serves as a potent medical countermeasure against lethal dose nerve agent toxicity in guinea pigs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis in plants: molecular and functional characterization of dihydrofolate synthetase and three isoforms of folylpolyglutamate synthetase in arabidopsis thaliana. tetrahydrofolate coenzymes involved in one-carbon (c1) metabolism are polyglutamylated. in organisms that synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, dihydrofolate synthetase (dhfs) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase (fpgs) catalyze the attachment of glutamate residues to the folate molecule. in this study we isolated cdnas coding a dhfs and three isoforms of fpgs from arabidopsis thaliana. the function of each enzyme was demonstrated by complementation of yeast mutants deficient in dhfs or fpgs activity, and by measuring in vitro glutamate incorporation into dihydrofolate or tetrahydrofolate. dhfs is present exclusively in the mitochondria, making this compartment the sole site of synthesis of dihydrofolate in the plant cell. in contrast, fpgs is present as distinct isoforms in the mitochondria, the cytosol, and the chloroplast. each isoform is encoded by a separate gene, a situation that is unique among eukaryotes. the compartmentation of fpgs isoforms is in agreement with the predominance of gamma-glutamyl-conjugated tetrahydrofolate derivatives and the presence of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and c1-tetrahydrofolate interconverting enzymes in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the plastids. thus, the combination of fpgs with these folate-mediated reactions can supply each compartment with the polyglutamylated folate coenzymes required for the reactions of c1 metabolism. also, the multicompartmentation of fpgs in the plant cell suggests that the transported forms of folate are unconjugated.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive g-proteins in the hormonal inhibition of dihydropyridine-sensitive ca2+ currents in an insulin-secreting cell line (rinm5f). adrenaline inhibits insulin secretion via pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanisms. since voltage-dependent ca2+ currents play a key role in insulin secretion, we examined whether adrenaline modulates voltage-dependent ca2+ currents of the rat insulinoma cell line, rinm5f. in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, dihydropyridine- but not omega-conotoxin-sensitive ca2+ currents were identified. adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors inhibited the ca2+ currents by about 50%. somatostatin which also inhibits insulin secretion was less efficient (inhibition by 20%). the hormonal inhibition of ca2+ currents was not affected by intracellularly applied camp but blocked by the intracellularly applied gdp analog guanosine 5'-o-(2-thiodiphosphate) and by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. in contrast to adrenaline and somatostatin, galanin, another inhibitor of insulin secretion, reduced ca2+ currents by about 40% in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. immunoblot experiments performed with antibodies generated against synthetic peptides revealed that membranes of rinm5f cells possess four pertussis toxin-sensitive g-proteins including gi1, gi2, go2, and another go subtype, most likely representing go1. in membranes of control but not of pertussis toxin-treated cells, adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors stimulated incorporation of the photo-reactive gtp analog [alpha-32p]gtp azidoanilide into pertussis toxin substrates comigrating with the alpha-subunits of gi2, go2, and the not further identified go subtype. the present findings indicate that activated alpha 2-adrenoceptors of rinm5f cells interact with multiple g-proteins, i.e. two forms of go and with gi2. these g-proteins are likely to be involved in the adrenaline-induced inhibition of dihydropyridine-sensitive ca2+ currents and in other signal transduction pathways contributing to the adrenaline-induced inhibition of insulin secretion.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ prenatal exposure to bisphenol a impacts midbrain dopamine neurons and hippocampal spine synapses in non-human primates. prevalent use of bisphenol-a (bpa) in the manufacture of resins, plastics and paper products has led to frequent exposure of most people to this endocrine disruptor. some rodent studies have suggested that bpa can exert detrimental effects on brain development. however as rodent models cannot be relied on to predict consequences of human exposure to bpa during development, it is important to investigate the effects of bpa on non-human primate brain development. previous research suggests that bpa preferentially targets dopamine neurons in ventral mesencephalon and glutamatergic neurons in hippocampus, so the present work examined the susceptibility of these systems to low dose bpa exposure at the fetal and juvenile stages of development in non-human primates. exposure of pregnant rhesus monkeys to relatively low levels of bpa during the final 2 months of gestation, induced abnormalities in fetal ventral mesencephalon and hippocampus. specifically, light microscopy revealed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing (dopamine) neurons in the midbrain of bpa-exposed fetuses and electron microscopy identified a reduction in spine synapses in the ca1 region of hippocampus. in contrast, administration of bpa to juvenile vervet monkeys (14-18 months of age) was without effect on these indices, or on dopamine and serotonin concentrations in striatum and prefrontal cortex, or on performance of a cognitive task that tests working memory capacity. these data indicate that bpa exerts an age-dependent detrimental impact on primate brain development, at blood levels within the range measured in humans having only environmental contact with bpa.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ the microsomal/peroxidase antigen: modulation of its expression in thyroid cells. evidence has accumulated in the last few years that the expression of the microsomal/peroxidase antigen (m/tpo-ag) in thyroid cells is induced by tsh, through pathways which involve intracellular camp accumulation and protein synthesis. these data have been found true in any thyroid system studied so far, both in terms of immunologic and enzymatic activity of tpo. tsh and camp also increase the levels of the specific mrna for tpo in thyroid cells from different species. whether this phenomenon is due to a direct transcriptional regulation of the tpo gene, as shown in dog thyroid cells, or to posttranscriptional effects, as it would appear in frtl-5 cells, remains to be clarified by future experiments. thyroid stimulating antibody (tsab) of graves' disease also stimulates the expression of m/tpo-ag. this finding gives further support to the relevance of tsab in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism and explains the well known observation that the "microsomal" antigen is particularly abundant in glands of graves' patients. the modulation of m/tpo-ag surface expression by tsh can explain the decrease of circulating anti-mab observed during l-thyroxine therapy in hypothyroid patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis. other agents, such as methimazole and sodium iodide, which influence thyroid cell function, do not directly interfere with the expression of m/tpo-ag. cytokines, such as gamma-interferon, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 have been shown to inhibit the tsh-induced increase of tpo mrna, but further investigations are required to elucidate the exact role of cytokines in the regulation of m/tpo-ag expression.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ pegylated recombinant human arginase (rharg-peg5,000mw) inhibits the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma through arginine depletion. hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is believed to be auxotrophic for arginine through the lack of expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ass). the successful use of the arginine-depleting enzyme arginine deiminase (adi) to treat ass-deficient tumors has opened up new possibilities for effective cancer therapy. nevertheless, many ass-positive hcc cell lines are found to be resistant to adi treatment, although most require arginine for proliferation. thus far, an arginine-depleting enzyme for killing ass-positive tumors has not been reported. here, we provide direct evidence that recombinant human arginase (rharg) inhibits ass-positive hccs. all the five human hcc cell lines we used were sensitive to rharg but adi had virtually no effect on these cells. they all expressed ass, but not ornithine transcarbamylase (otc), the enzyme that converts ornithine, the product of degradation of arginine with rharg, to citrulline, which is converted back to arginine via ass. transfection of hcc cells with otc resulted in resistance to rharg. thus, otc expression alone may be sufficient to induce rharg resistance in ass-positive hcc cells. this surprising correlation between the lack of otc expression and sensitivity of ass-positive hcc cells shows that otc-deficient hccs are sensitive to rharg-mediated arginine depletion. therefore, pretreatment tumor gene expression profiling of ass and otc could aid in predicting tumor response to arginine depletion with arginine-depleting enzymes. we have also shown that the rharg native enzyme and the pegylated rharg (rharg-peg(5,000mw)) gave similar anticancer efficacy in vitro. furthermore, the growth of the otc-deficient hep3b tumor cells (ass-positive and adi-resistant) in mice was inhibited by treatment with rharg-peg(5,000mw), which is active alone and is synergistic in combination with 5-fluorouracil. thus, our data suggest that rharg-peg(5,000mw) is a novel agent for effective cancer therapy.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ibuprofen inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated cl- secretion. we evaluated the acute effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on camp-mediated cl- secretion (isc) in both colonic and airway epithelia. in t84 cells, ibuprofen inhibited the forskolin-dependent isc in a concentration-dependent manner, having an apparent ki of 142 microm. salicylic acid inhibited isc with an apparent ki of 646 microm. we determined whether ibuprofen would also inhibit the forskolin-stimulated isc in primary cultures of mouse trachea epithelia (mte) and human bronchial epithelia (hbe). similar to our results in t84 cells, ibuprofen (500 microm) inhibited the forskolin-induced isc in mtes and hbes by 59+/-4% (n = 11) and 39+/-6% (n = 8), respectively. nystatin was employed to selectively permeabilize the basolateral or apical membrane to determine the effect of ibuprofen on apical cl- (icl) and basolateral k+ (ik) currents after stimulation by forskolin. after forskolin stimulation, ibuprofen (500 microm) reduced both the icl and ik; reducing icl and ik by 60 and 15%, respectively. to determine whether this inhibition of icl was due to the inhibition of cftr, the effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on cftr cl- channels in excised, inside-out patches from l-cells were evaluated. ibuprofen (300 microm) reduced cftr cl- current by 60+/-16% and this was explained by a short-lived block (approximately 1.2 ms) which causes an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.07+/-0.04 pa to 0.59+/-0.04 pa (n = 3). similarly, salicylic acid (3 mm) reduced cftr cl- current by 50+/-8% with an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.08+/-0.03 pa to 0.48+/-0.06 pa (n = 4). based on these results, we conclude that the nsaids ibuprofen and salicylic acid inhibit camp-mediated cl- secretion in human colonic and airway epithelia via a direct inhibition of cftr cl- channels as well as basolateral membrane k+ channels. this may reduce their efficacy in conjunction with other therapeutic strategies designed to increase cftr expression and/or function in secretory epithelia.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ neurotoxicity of "ecstasy" and its metabolites in human dopaminergic differentiated sh-sy5y cells. ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or mdma) is a widely abused recreational drug, reported to produce neurotoxic effects, both in laboratory animals and in humans. mdma metabolites can be major contributors for mdma neurotoxicity. this work studied the neurotoxicity of mdma and its catechol metabolites, α-methyldopamine (α-meda) and n-methyl-α-methyldopamine (n-me-α-meda) in human dopaminergic sh-sy5y cells differentiated with retinoic acid and 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. differentiation led to sh-sy5y neurons with higher ability to accumulate dopamine and higher resistance towards dopamine neurotoxicity. mdma catechol metabolites were neurotoxic to sh-sy5y neurons, leading to caspase 3-independent cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. mdma did not show a concentration- and time-dependent death. pre-treatment with the antioxidant and glutathione precursor, n-acetylcysteine (nac), resulted in strong protection against the mdma metabolites' neurotoxicity. neither the superoxide radical scavenger, tiron, nor the inhibitor of the dopamine (da) transporter, gbr 12909, prevented the metabolites' toxicity. cells exposed to α-meda showed an increase in intracellular glutathione (gsh) levels, which, at the 48 h time-point, was not dependent in the activity increase of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-gcs), revealing a possible transient effect. importantly, pre-treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (bso), an inhibitor of γ-gcs, prevented α-meda induced increase in gsh levels, but did not augment this metabolite cytotoxicity. even so, bso pre-treatment abolished nac protective effects against α-meda neurotoxicity, which were, at least partially, due to gsh de novo synthesis. inversely, pre-treatment of cells with bso augmented n-me-α-meda-induced neurotoxicity, but only slightly affected nac neuroprotection. in conclusion, mdma catechol metabolites promote differential toxic effects to differentiated dopaminergic human sh-sy5y cells.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cask is a new intracellular modulator of p2x3 receptors. atp-gated p2x3 receptors of sensory ganglion neurons are important transducers of painful stimuli and are modulated by extracellular algogenic substances, via changes in the receptor phosphorylation state. the present study investigated the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase cask in interacting and controlling p2x3 receptor expression and function in mouse trigeminal ganglia. most ganglion neurons in situ or in culture co-expressed p2x3 and cask. cask was immunoprecipitated with p2x3 receptors from trigeminal ganglia and from p2x3/cask-cotransfected hek cells. recombinant p2x3/cask expression in hek cells increased serine phosphorylation of p2x3 receptors, typically associated with receptor upregulation. cask deletion mutants also enhanced p2x3 subunit expression. after silencing cask, cell surface p2x3 receptor expression was decreased, which is consistent with depressed p2x3 currents. the reduction of p2x3 expression levels was reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor mg-132. moreover, neuronal cask/p2x3 interaction was upregulated by ngf signaling and downregulated by p2x3 agonist-induced desensitization. these data suggest a novel interaction between cask and p2x3 receptors with positive outcome for receptor stability and function. as cask-mediated control of p2x3 receptors was dependent on the receptor activation state, cask represents an intracellular gateway to regulate purinergic nociceptive signaling. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ new progestagens for contraceptive use. the progestins have different pharmacologic properties depending upon the parent molecule, usually testosterone or progesterone (p), from which they are derived. very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce considerable differences in the activity of the derivative. in hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (e) usually ethinyl-estradiol (ee). the development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (pr) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. these include dienogest (dng), drospirenone (drsp), nestorone (nes), nomegestrol acetate (nomac) and trimegestone (tmg). these new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone p. drsp differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. it is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. the antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. tmg and nes are the most potent progestins synthesized to date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto-desogestrel (keto-dsg) and levonorgestrel (lng). the new molecules tmg, drsp and dng also have antiandrogenic activity. striking differences exist regarding the side effects among the progestins and the combination with ee leads to other reactions related to the e itself and whether the associated progestin counterbalances, more or less, the estrogenic action. the 19-norprogesterone molecules and the new molecules drsp and dng are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the lipid profile. given their pharmacological properties, it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on metabolic or vascular risks. however, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large clinical trials.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ p2y(2) receptor agonist ins37217 enhances functional recovery after detachment caused by subretinal injection in normal and rds mice. purpose: to evaluate the effects of ins37217 on the recovery of retinal function after experimental retinal detachment induced by subretinal injection. methods: subretinal injections of 1 micro l of fluorescent microbeads, saline, or ins37217 (1-200 micro m) were made by the transvitreal method in normal (c57bl/6) mice and in mice heterozygous for the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene. control, mock-injected animals underwent corneal puncture without injection. histologic and erg evaluations were made at 0 to 1 and 8 hours, and 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 60 days post injection (pi). dna fragmentation was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (tunel). results: a single subretinal injection of saline solution containing fluorescent beads caused a histologically evident retinal detachment and distributed the microbeads to almost all the subretinal space. spontaneous reattachment occurred within 24 hours after injection and was accompanied by evident retinal folding that appeared largely resolved by 6 days later. relative to controls, injection of saline resulted in approximately 40% recovery of dark-adapted a-wave amplitude at 24 hours pi and gradually improved to approximately 90% of controls at 2 months pi. subretinal injection of saline containing ins37217 (10 micro m) significantly increased rod and cone erg of normal and rds(+/-) mice at 1 and 10 days pi, when compared with injection of saline alone. additionally, ins37217 reduced the number of tunel-positive photoreceptors and the enhanced rate of reattachment. conclusions: enhancement of erg recovery by ins37217 is likely due to reduced retinal folding and cell death associated with detachment. these results support the use of ins37217 to help restore function after therapies that involve subretinal administration of drugs in animal models of retinal diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ current perspectives on parathyroid hormone (pth) and pth-related protein (pthrp) as bone anabolic therapies. osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mineral density and/or poor bone microarchitecture leading to an increased risk of fractures. the skeletal alterations in osteoporosis are a consequence of a relative deficit of bone formation compared to bone resorption. osteoporosis therapies have mostly relied on antiresorptive drugs. an alternative therapeutic approach for osteoporosis is currently available, based on the intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (pth). bone anabolism caused by pth therapy is mainly accounted for by the ability of pth to increase osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast survival. pth and pth-related protein (pthrp)-an abundant local factor in bone- interact with the common pth type 1 receptor with similar affinities in osteoblasts. studies mainly in osteoporosis rodent models and limited data in postmenopausal women suggest that n-terminal pthrp peptides might be considered a promising bone anabolic therapy. in addition, putative osteogenic actions of pthrp might be ascribed not only to its n-terminal domain but also to its pth-unrelated c-terminal region. in this review, we discuss the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the anabolic actions of pth and the similar potential of pth-related protein (pthrp) to increase bone mass and improve bone regeneration.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ cell cycle regulation by glucosamine in human pulmonary epithelial cells. airway epithelial cells play an important role against intruding pathogens. glucosamine, a commonly used supplemental compound, has recently begun to be regarded as a potential anti-inflammatory molecule. this study aimed to uncover how glucosamine impacts on cellular proliferation in human alveolar epithelial cells (a549) and bronchial epithelial cells (hbecs). with trypan blue-exclusion assay, we observed that glucosamine (10, 20, 50 mm) caused a decrease in cell number at 24 and 48 h; with a flow cytometric analysis, we also noted an enhanced cell accumulation within the g(0)/g(1) phase at 24 h and induction of late apoptosis at 24 and 48 h by glucosamine (10, 20, 50 mm) in a549 cells and hbecs. examination of phosphorylation in retinoblastoma (rb) protein, we found an inhibitory effect by glucosamine at 20 and 50 mm. glucosamine at 50 mm was demonstrated to elevate both the mrna and protein expression of p53 and heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1), but also caused a reduction in p21 protein expression. in addition, glucosamine attenuated p21 protein stability via the proteasomal proteolytic pathway, as well as inducing p21 nuclear accumulation. altogether, our results suggest that a high dose of glucosamine may inhibit cell proliferation through apoptosis and disturb cell cycle progression with a halt at g(0)/g(1) phase, and that this occurs, at least in part, by a reduction in rb phosphorylation together with modulation of p21, p53 and ho-1 expression, and nuclear p21 accumulation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ supervillin-mediated suppression of p53 protein enhances cell survival. integrin-based adhesions promote cell survival as well as cell motility and invasion. we show here that the adhesion regulatory protein supervillin increases cell survival by decreasing levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and downstream target genes. rnai-mediated knockdown of a new splice form of supervillin (isoform 4) or both isoforms 1 and 4 increases the amount of p53 and cell death, whereas p53 levels decrease after overexpression of either supervillin isoform. cellular responses to dna damage induced by etoposide or doxorubicin include down-regulation of endogenous supervillin coincident with increases in p53. in dna-damaged supervillin knockdown cells, p53 knockdown or inhibition partially rescues the loss of cell metabolic activity, a measure of cell proliferation. knockdown of the p53 deubiquitinating enzyme usp7/hausp also reverses the supervillin phenotype, blocking the increase in p53 levels seen after supervillin knockdown and accentuating the decrease in p53 levels triggered by supervillin overexpression. conversely, supervillin overexpression decreases the association of usp7 and p53 and attenuates usp7-mediated p53 deubiquitination. usp7 binds directly to the supervillin n terminus and can deubiquitinate and stabilize supervillin. supervillin also is stabilized by derivatization with the ubiquitin-like protein sumo1. these results show that supervillin regulates cell survival through control of p53 levels and suggest that supervillin and its interaction partners at sites of cell-substrate adhesion constitute a locus for cross-talk between survival signaling and cell motility pathways.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ p2 receptor mrna expression profiles in human lymphocytes, monocytes and cd34+ stem and progenitor cells. background: extracellular nucleotides (atp, adp, utp and udp) exert a wide range of biological effects in blood cells mediated by multiple ionotropic p2x receptors and g protein-coupled p2y receptors. although pharmacological experiments have suggested the presence of several p2 receptor subtypes on monocytes and lymphocytes, some results are contradictory. few physiological functions have been firmly established to a specific receptor subtype, partly because of a lack of truly selective agonists and antagonists. this stimulated us to investigate the expression of p2x and p2y receptors in human lymphocytes and monocytes with a newly established quantitative mrna assay for p2 receptors. in addition, we describe for the first time the expression of p2 receptors in cd34+ stem and progenitor cells implicating a potential role of p2 receptors in hematopoietic lineage and progenitor/stem cell function. results: using a quantitative mrna assay, we assessed the hypothesis that there are specific p2 receptor profiles in inflammatory cells. the p2x4 receptor had the highest expression in lymphocytes and monocytes. among the p2y receptors, p2y12 and p2y2 had highest expression in lymphocytes, while the p2y2 and p2y13 had highest expression in monocytes. several p2 receptors were expressed (p2y2, p2y1, p2y12, p2y13, p2y11, p2x1, p2x4) in cd34+ stem and progenitor cells. conclusions: the most interesting findings were the high mrna expression of p2y12 receptors in lymphocytes potentially explaining the anti-inflammatory effects of clopidogrel, p2y13 receptors in monocytes and a previously unrecognised expression of p2x4 in lymphocytes and monocytes. in addition, for the first time p2 receptor mrna expression patterns was studied in cd34+ stem and progenitor cells. several p2 receptors were expressed (p2y2, p2y1, p2y12, p2y13, p2y11, p2x1, p2x4), indicating a role in differentiation and proliferation. thus, it is possible that specific antibodies to p2 receptors could be used to identify progenitors for monocytes, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ central sympatholysis as a novel countermeasure for cocaine-induced sympathetic activation and vasoconstriction in humans. objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether cocaine's sympathomimetic actions can be reversed by a potent centrally acting alpha2 adrenergic receptor (ar) agonist (dexmedetomidine). background: we recently showed that cocaine stimulates the human cardiovascular system primarily by acting in the brain to increase sympathetic nerve activity (sna), the neural stimulus to norepinephrine release. thus, sna constitutes a putative new drug target to block cocaine's adverse cardiovascular effects at their origin. methods: in 22 healthy cocaine-naive humans, we measured skin sna (microneurography) and skin blood flow (laser doppler velocimetry) as well as heart rate and blood pressure before and after intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg) alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine or saline. results: during intranasal cocaine alone, sna increased by 2-fold and skin vascular resistance increased from 13.2 +/- 2.3 to 20.1 +/- 2.2 resistance units while mean arterial pressure increased by 14 +/- 3 mm hg and heart rate by 18 +/- 3 beats/min (p < 0.01). dexmedetomidine abolished these increases, whereas intravenous saline was without effect. dexmedetomidine was effective in blocking these sympathomimetic actions of cocaine even in all 7 subjects who were homozygous for the del322-325 polymorphism in the alpha2c ar, a loss-of-function mutation that is highly enriched in blacks. conclusions: the data advance the novel hypothesis that central sympatholysis with dexmedetomidine constitutes a highly effective countermeasure for cocaine's sympathomimetic actions on the human cardiovascular system, even in individuals carrying the alpha2cdel322-325 polymorphism.

consider the abstract: $ downregulation of glutaredoxin but not glutathione loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in female mice cns: implications in excitotoxicity. oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction play synergistic roles in neurodegeneration. maintenance of thiol homeostasis is important for normal mitochondrial function and dysregulation of protein thiol homeostasis by oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. we examined the critical roles played by the antioxidant, non-protein thiol, glutathione and related enzyme, glutaredoxin in maintaining mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity caused by beta-n-oxalyl amino-l-alanine (l-boaa), the causative factor of neurolathyrism, a motor neuron disease involving the pyramidal system. l-boaa causes loss of gsh and inhibition of mitochondrial complex i in lumbosacral cord of male mice through oxidation of thiol groups, while female mice are resistant. reducing gsh levels in female mice cns by pretreatment with diethyl maleate or l-propargyl glycine did not result in inhibition of complex i activity, unlike male mice. further, treatment of female mice depleted of gsh with l-boaa did not induce inhibition of complex i indicating that gsh levels were not critical for maintaining complex i activity in female mice unlike their male counterpart. glutaredoxin, a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase helps maintain redox status of proteins and downregulation of glutaredoxin results in loss of mitochondrial complex i activity. female mice express higher levels of glutaredoxin in certain cns regions and downregulation of glutaredoxin using antisense oligonucleotides sensitizes them to l-boaa toxicity seen as mitochondrial complex i loss. ovariectomy downregulates glutaredoxin and renders female mice vulnerable to l-boaa toxicity as evidenced by activation of ap1, loss of gsh and complex i activity indicating the important role of glutaredoxin in neuroprotection. estrogen protects against mitochondrial dysfunction caused by excitotoxicity by maintaining cellular redox status through higher constitutive expression of glutaredoxin in the cns. therapeutic interventions designed to upregulate glutaredoxin may offer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in motor neurons.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
