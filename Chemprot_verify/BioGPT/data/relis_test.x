consider the abstract: $ androgen antagonistic effect of estramustine phosphate (emp) metabolites on wild-type and mutated androgen receptor. estramustine phosphate is used frequently, alone or in combination with other antitumor agents, for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. estramustine phosphate is metabolically activated in vivo, and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol inhibit the assembly of microtubules [for review see: kreis w, in: concepts, mechanisms, and new targets for chemotherapy (ed. muggia fm), pp. 163-184. kluwer academic publishers, boston, 1995]. we investigated, by displacement of [3h]methyltrienolone in the presence of 2.5 mm of triamcinolone acetonide, the binding of estramustine phosphate and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol, as well as other antiandrogen agents including alpha-estradiol, bicalutamide, and hydroxyflutamide, to the mutated androgen receptor (m-ar) in lncap cells and to the wild-type androgen receptor in wild-type ar cdna expression plasmid (w-par0) cdna-transfected hela cells. analogous to the antiandrogens, bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, binding of estramustine phosphate metabolites to the androgen receptor was observed. the ec50 values (in microm) were: estramustine phosphate, > 10; estramustine, 3.129 +/- 0.312; estromustine; 2.612 +/- 0.584; estrone, 0.800 +/- 0.090; alpha-estradiol, 1.051 +/- 0.096; beta-estradiol, 0.523 +/- 0.028; bicalutamide, 4.920 +/- 0.361; and hydroxyflutamide, 0.254 +/- 0.012. the transactivation assay demonstrated that, analogous to bicalutamide, estramustine could not induce luciferase activity in either w-par0 or m-parl transfected hela cells. in contrast, a strong induction of the reporter activity by dihydrotestosterone was observed. down-regulation of prostate-specific antigen (psa) expression, an ar-target gene, by estramustine and bicalutamide was accompanied by the blockade of the mutated androgen receptor. exposure of lncap cells to estramustine for 24 hr caused transcriptional inhibition of psa in a concentration-dependent manner. the levels of psa mrna decreased 56 and 90% when lncap cells were treated with 5 and 10 microm of estramustine, respectively (ic50 = 10.97 +/- 1.68 microm). binding of hydroxyflutamide to m-ar in lncap cells resulted in a concentration-dependent stimulation of psa expression, suggesting that hydroxyflutamide acted as an agonist of the m-ar. our data indicate that estramustine phosphate metabolites perform as androgen antagonists of ar, an additional mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of estramustine phosphate in patients with prostate cancer.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ synthesis of thrombin-inhibiting heparin mimetics without side effects. unwanted side effects of pharmacologically active compounds can usually be eliminated by structural modifications. but the complex heterogeneous structure of the polysaccharide heparin has limited this approach to fragmentation, leading to slightly better-tolerated heparin preparations of low molecular mass. despite this improvement, heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (hit), related to an interaction with platelet factor 4 (pf4) and, to a lesser extent, haemorrhages, remain significant side effects of heparinotherapy. breakthroughs in oligosaccharide chemistry made possible the total synthesis of the pentasaccharide antithrombin-binding site of heparin. this pentasaccharide represents a new family of potential antithrombotic drugs, devoid of thrombin inhibitory properties, and free of undesired interactions with blood and vessel components. to obtain more potent and well-tolerated antithrombotic drugs, we wished to synthesize heparin mimetics able to inhibit thrombin, that is, longer oligosaccharides. like thrombin inhibition, undesired interactions are directly correlated to the charge and the size of the molecules, so we had to design structures that were able to discriminate between thrombin and other proteins, particularly pf4. here we describe the use of multistep converging synthesis to obtain sulphated oligosaccharides that meet these requirements.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ comparison of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone with clozapine and olanzapine: inhibition of dorsal raphe cell firing and the role of 5-ht1a receptor activation. ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent which binds with high affinity to 5-ht1a receptors (ki = 3.4 nm), in addition to 5-ht1d, 5-ht2, and d2 sites. while it is an antagonist at these latter receptors, ziprasidone behaves as a 5-ht1a agonist in vitro in adenylate cyclase measurements. the goal of the present study was to examine the 5-ht1a properties of ziprasidone in vivo using as a marker of central 5-ht1a activity the inhibition of firing of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. in anesthetized rats, ziprasidone dose-dependently slowed raphe unit activity (ed50 = 300 micrograms/kg i.v.) as did the atypical antipsychotics clozapine (ed50 = 250 micrograms/kg i.v.) and olanzapine (ed50 = 1000 micrograms/kg i.v.). pretreatment with the 5-ht1a antagonist way-100,635 (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) prevented the ziprasidone-induced inhibition; the same dose of way-100,635 had little effect on the inhibition produced by clozapine and olanzapine. because all three agents also bind to alpha 1 receptors, antagonists of which inhibit serotonin neuronal firing, this aspect of their pharmacology was assessed with desipramine (dmi), a ne re-uptake blocker previously shown to reverse the effects of alpha 1 antagonists on raphe unit activity. dmi (5 mg/kg i.v.) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of ziprasidone but produced nearly complete reversal of that of clozapine and olanzapine. these profiles suggest a mechanism of action for each agent, 5-ht1a agonism for ziprasidone and alpha 1 antagonism for clozapine and olanzapine. the 5-ht1a agonist activity reported here clearly distinguishes ziprasidone from currently available antipsychotic agents and suggests that this property may play a significant role in its pharmacologic actions.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(p < 0.001). postoperative packed cell volume values were higher in the tranexamic acid group despite fewer blood transfusions. postoperative concentrations of plasminogen were decreased significantly in the tranexamic acid group (p < 0.001). platelet count, pt, aptt, bleeding time, beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinogen and fdp concentrations did not differ between groups, but d-dimer concentrations were increased in the control group. thromboembolic complications occurred in two patients in the control group compared with none in the tranexamic acid group.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ correlations between serotonin level and single-cell firing in the rat's nucleus raphe magnus. the relation between serotonin release and electrical activity was examined in the nucleus raphe magnus of rats anesthetized with pentobarbital. serotonin levels were monitored through a carbon-fiber microelectrode by fast cyclic voltammetry (usually at 1 hz). single-cell firing was recorded through the same microelectrode, except during the voltammetry waveform and associated electrical artifact (totaling about 30 ms). multi-barrel micropipettes incorporating the voltammetry electrode were used for iontophoresis of drugs. cells were inhibited, excited or unaffected by noxious mechanical skin stimulation. these were respectively designated as off(m) cells, on(m) cells and neutral(m) cells, m denoting mechanical. during 3 min of pinching, serotonin slowly rose near seven of 14 on(m) cells and 26 of 46 off(m) cells; it fell near two off(m) cells; it was unchanged near all other cells, including six neutral(m) cells. on a finer spatiotemporal scale, near four of seven on(m) cells, 10 of 14 off(m) cells and 0 of four neutral(m) cells, average serotonin levels fell significantly within +/- 100 ms of spontaneous spikes. lower serotonin may have caused the higher spike probability; the converse is theoretically unlikely, since delays between release and detection are estimated to exceed 100 ms. increased serotonin and decreased firing were always seen following iontophoresis or intravenous injection (1 mg/kg) of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor clomipramine (n = 7). iontophoresis of +/- propranolol, whose serotonergic actions include antagonism and partial agonism at 5-ht1 receptors, also increased serotonin and decreased firing (n=4). methiothepin (intravenous, 1 mg/kg), whose serotonergic actions include 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 antagonism, typically raised serotonin levels (four of five cells) and always blocked inhibition by clomipramine (n = 3). iontophoresis of glutamate always lowered serotonin and increased firing (n = 4). since serotonin levels and firing were usually inversely correlated, except near on(m) cells during pinch, we propose that serotonin is released from terminals of incoming nociceptive afferents. prior neuroanatomical knowledge favors a midbrain origin for these afferents, while some of the drug findings suggest that their terminals possess inhibitory serotonergic autoreceptors, possibly of 5-ht1b subtype. the released serotonin could contribute to the inhibition of off(m) cells and excitation of on(m) cells by noxious stimulation, since inhibitory 5-ht1a receptors and excitatory 5-ht2 receptors, respectively, have previously been shown to dominate their serotonergic responses.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin selectively disrupts kinase-mediated signaling events of t-lymphocyte activation. the 90-kda heat shock protein (hsp90) is the most abundant molecular chaperone of eukaryotic cells. its chaperone function in folding nascent proteins seems to be restricted to a subset of proteins including major components of signal transduction pathways (eg, nuclear hormone receptors, transcription factors, and protein kinases). improper function of these proteins can be induced by selective disruption of their complexes with hsp90 using the benzoquinonoid ansamycin geldanamycin. in this study, we demonstrate that geldanamycin treatment blocks interleukin (il)-2 secretion, il-2 receptor expression, and proliferation of stimulated t-lymphocytes. moreover, geldanamycin decreases the amount and phosphorylation of lck and raf-1 kinases and prevents activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (erk)-2 kinase. geldanamycin also disrupts the t-cell receptor-mediated activation of nuclear factor of activated t-cells (nf-at). treatment with geldanamycin, however, does not affect the activation of lysophosphatide acyltransferase, which is a plasma membrane enzyme coupled to the t-cell receptor after t-cell stimulation. through demonstrating the selective inhibition of kinase-related t-lymphocyte responses by geldanamycin, our results emphasize the substantial role of hsp90-kinase complexes in t-cell activation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ severe impairment of salivation in na+/k+/2cl- cotransporter (nkcc1)-deficient mice. the salivary fluid secretory mechanism is thought to require na(+)/k(+)/2cl(-) cotransporter-mediated cl(-) uptake. to directly test this possibility we studied the in vivo and in vitro functioning of acinar cells from the parotid glands of mice with targeted disruption of na(+)/k(+)/2cl(-) cotransporter isoform 1 (nkcc1), the gene encoding the salivary na(+)/k(+)/2cl(-) cotransporter. in wild-type mice nkcc1 was localized to the basolateral membranes of parotid acinar cells, whereas expression was not detected in duct cells. the lack of functional nkcc1 resulted in a dramatic reduction (>60%) in the volume of saliva secreted in response to a muscarinic agonist, the primary in situ salivation signal. consistent with defective cl(-) uptake, a loss of bumetanide-sensitive cl(-) influx was observed in parotid acinar cells from mice lacking nkcc1. cl(-)/ hco(3)(-) exchanger activity was increased in parotid acinar cells isolated from knockout mice suggesting that the residual saliva secreted by mice lacking nkcc1 is associated with anion exchanger-dependent cl(-) uptake. indeed, expression of the cl(-)/ hco(3)(-) exchanger ae2 was enhanced suggesting that this transporter compensates for the loss of functional na(+)/k(+)/2cl(-) cotransporter. furthermore, the ability of the parotid gland to conserve nacl was abolished in nkcc1-deficient mice. this deficit was not associated with changes in the morphology of the ducts, but transcript levels for the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of the epithelial na(+) channel were reduced. these data directly demonstrate that nkcc1 is the major cl(-) uptake mechanism across the basolateral membrane of acinar cells and is critical for driving saliva secretion in vivo.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ impaired expression of the uncoupling protein-3 gene in skeletal muscle during lactation: fibrates and troglitazone reverse lactation-induced downregulation of the uncoupling protein-3 gene. the expression of uncoupling protein (ucp)-3 mrna in skeletal muscle is dramatically reduced during lactation in mice. the reduction in ucp-3 mrna levels lowers the amount of the ucp-3 protein in skeletal muscle mitochondria during lactation. spontaneous or abrupt weaning reverses the downregulation of the ucp-3 mrna but not the reduction in ucp-3 protein levels. in lactating and virgin mice, however, fasting increases ucp-3 mrna levels. changes in ucp-3 mrna occur in parallel with modifications in the levels of free fatty acids, which are reduced in lactation and are upregulated due to weaning or fasting. modifications in the energy nutritional stress of lactating dams achieved by manipulating litter sizes do not influence ucp-3 mrna levels in skeletal muscle. conversely, when mice are fed a high-fat diet after parturition, the downregulation of ucp-3 mrna and ucp-3 protein levels due to lactation is partially reversed, as is the reduction in serum free fatty acid levels. treatment of lactating mice with a single injection of bezafibrate, an activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar), raises ucp-3 mrna in skeletal muscle to levels similar to those in virgin mice. 4-chloro-6-[(2,3-xylidine)-pirimidinylthio] acetic acid (wy-14,643), a specific ligand of the ppar-alpha subtype, causes the most dramatic increase in ucp-3 mrna, whereas troglitazone, a specific activator of ppar-gamma, also significantly increases ucp-3 mrna abundance in skeletal muscle of lactating mice. however, in virgin mice, bezafibrate and wy-14,643 do not significantly affect ucp-3 mrna expression, whereas troglitazone is at least as effective as it is in lactating dams. it is proposed that the ucp-3 gene is regulated in skeletal muscle during lactation in response to changes in circulating free fatty acids by mechanisms involving activation of ppars. the impaired expression of the ucp-3 gene is consistent with the involvement of ucp-3 gene regulation in the reduction of the use of fatty acids as fuel by the skeletal muscle and in impaired adaptative thermogenesis, both of which are major metabolic adaptations that occur during lactation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

[3h]paroxetine binding was investigated in 72 control subjects and 72 patients, of which five patients met type 2 alcohol dependence criteria. genotyping was carried out in all patients and control subjects. a significant influence of duration of alcohol dependence was found on the [3h]paroxetine binding k(d) but not b(max.) neither alcohol-dependent nor control subjects showed any differences in b(max) or k(d). s-allele carriers did not show a decreased binding or lower dissociation constant. furthermore, no significant interaction between b(max) and k(d) with either 5-httlpr genotype or impulsivity was revealed. this was the first study to investigate platelet [3h]paroxetine binding in alcohol-dependent and age-matched control subjects in relation to the 5-httlpr genotype. no differences concerning 5-httlpr-alleles were found in these groups furthermore, no significant interaction between these parameters and impulsivity was shown in alcohol-dependent subjects. these results do not support previous results of altered [3h]paroxetine binding sites in alcohol-dependent subjects or 5-httlpr s-allele carriers. k(d) might be influenced by duration of alcohol dependence, but not sufficiently to yield differences between alcohol-dependent and control subjects.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ biochemistry of cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors and molecular pathology of cox-2 in neoplasia. several types of human tumors overexpress cyclooxygenase (cox) -2 but not cox-1, and gene knockout transfection experiments demonstrate a central role of cox-2 in experimental tumorigenesis. cox-2 produces prostaglandins that inhibit apoptosis and stimulate angiogenesis and invasiveness. selective cox-2 inhibitors reduce prostaglandin synthesis, restore apoptosis, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. in animal studies they limit carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. in contrast, aspirin-like nonselective nsaids such as sulindac and indomethacin inhibit not only the enzymatic action of the highly inducible, proinflammatory cox-2 but the constitutively expressed, cytoprotective cox-1 as well. consequently, nonselective nsaids can cause platelet dysfunction, gastrointestinal ulceration, and kidney damage. for that reason, selective inhibition of cox-2 to treat neoplastic proliferation is preferable to nonselective inhibition. selective cox-2 inhibitors, such as meloxicam, celecoxib (sc-58635), and rofecoxib (mk-0966), are nsaids that have been modified chemically to preferentially inhibit cox-2 but not cox-1. for instance, meloxicam inhibits the growth of cultured colon cancer cells (hca-7 and moser-s) that express cox-2 but has no effect on hct-116 tumor cells that do not express cox-2. ns-398 induces apoptosis in cox-2 expressing lncap prostate cancer cells and, surprisingly, in colon cancer s/ks cells that does not express cox-2. this effect may due to induction of apoptosis through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and down-regulation of bcl-2, as has been demonstrated for some nonselective nsaids, for instance, flurbiprofen. cox-2 mrna and cox-2 protein is constitutively expressed in the kidney, brain, spinal cord, and ductus deferens, and in the uterus during implantation. in addition, cox-2 is constitutively and dominantly expressed in the pancreatic islet cells. these findings might somewhat limit the use of presently available selective cox-2 inhibitors in cancer prevention but will probably not deter their successful application for the treatment of human cancers.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the aromatic-l-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa is selectively cytotoxic to human pulmonary carcinoid and small cell lung carcinoma cells. the carcinoid tumor is an uncommon neuroendocrine neoplasm the hallmark of which is excessive serotonin production. in studying kinetics of tryptophan hydroxylase and aromatic-l-amino acid decarboxylase (aaad) in human carcinoid hepatic metastases and adjacent normal liver (j. a. gilbert et al, biochem. pharmacol., 50: 845-850, 1995), we identified one significant difference: the vmax of carcinoid aaad was 50-fold higher than that in normal liver. here, we report western and northern analyses detecting large quantities of aaad polypeptide and mrna in human carcinoid primary as well as metastatic tumors compared with normal surrounding tissues. to assess the feasibility of targeting these high aaad levels for chemotherapy, aaad inhibitors carbidopa (alpha-methyl-dopahydrazine), alpha-monofluoromethyldopa (mfmd), and 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (nsd-1015) were incubated (72 h) with nci-h727 human lung carcinoid cells. carbidopa and mfmd were lethal (ic50 = 29 +/- 2 microm and 56 +/- 6 microm, respectively); nsd-1015 had no effect on proliferation. on exposure to other human tumor lines, carbidopa was lethal only to nci-h146 and nci-h209 small cell lung carcinoma (sclc) lines (ic50 = 12 +/- 1 microm and 22 +/- 5 microm, respectively). carbidopa (100 microm) decreased growth of (but did not kill) sk-n-sh neuroblastoma and a204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells and did not affect proliferation of du 145 prostate, mcf7 breast, or nci-h460 large cell lung carcinoma lines. the rank order of lines by aaad activity was nci-h146 > nci-h209 > sk-n-sh > nci-h727, whereas a204, du 145, mcf7, and nci-h460 had no measurable activity. for lung tumor lines (carcinoid, two sclc, and one large cell lung carcinoma), aaad activity was correlated with the potency of carbidopa-induced cytotoxicity. however, carcinoid cell death was not solely attributable to complete inhibition of either aaad activity or the serotonin synthetic pathway. in further evaluating potential applications of these findings with carbidopa, we determined that sublethal doses of carbidopa produced additive cytotoxic effects in carcinoid cells in combination with etoposide and cytotoxic synergy in sclc cells when coincubated with topotecan.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ metformin increases amp-activated protein kinase activity in skeletal muscle of subjects with type 2 diabetes. metformin is an effective hypoglycemic drug that lowers blood glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing glucose disposal in skeletal muscle; however, the molecular site of metformin action is not well understood. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) activity increases in response to depletion of cellular energy stores, and this enzyme has been implicated in the stimulation of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis. we recently reported that ampk is activated by metformin in cultured rat hepatocytes, mediating the inhibitory effects of the drug on hepatic glucose production. in the present study, we evaluated whether therapeutic doses of metformin increase ampk activity in vivo in subjects with type 2 diabetes. metformin treatment for 10 weeks significantly increased ampk alpha2 activity in the skeletal muscle, and this was associated with increased phosphorylation of ampk on thr172 and decreased acetyl-coa carboxylase-2 activity. the increase in ampk alpha2 activity was likely due to a change in muscle energy status because atp and phosphocreatine concentrations were lower after metformin treatment. metformin-induced increases in ampk activity were associated with higher rates of glucose disposal and muscle glycogen concentrations. these findings suggest that the metabolic effects of metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes may be mediated by the activation of ampk alpha2.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ thalidomide prevents alcoholic liver injury in rats through suppression of kupffer cell sensitization and tnf-alpha production. background & aims: sensitization of kupffer cells (kcs) to lipopolysaccharide (lps) and overproduction of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha are critical for progression of alcoholic liver injury. thalidomide has been shown to suppress tnf-alpha production from macrophages. accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine whether thalidomide could prevent alcohol-induced liver injury. methods: rats were given ethanol (5 g/kg body wt) and thalidomide (5 mg/kg) once every 24 hours intragastrically. to assess the sensitization of kupffer cells, lps (5 mg/kg intravenously) was administered and liver histology was evaluated 24 hours later. kcs were isolated after 4 weeks of ethanol treatment and intracellular ca2+ ([ca2+]i) was measured using fura-2, whereas tnf-alpha was evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. cd14 was determined by western and fluorescence staining. results: treatment with ethanol for 8 weeks caused marked steatosis, necrosis, and inflammation in the liver. these pathologic parameters were diminished markedly by treatment with thalidomide. in the 4-week ethanol group, the lps-induced liver damage was aggravated and kcs were sensitized to lps. coadministration of thalidomide with ethanol prevented the kc sensitization completely. furthermore, thalidomide abolished the lps-induced increase in cd14 expression and [ca2+]i elevation in kcs. gut permeability was increased about 10-fold after 4 weeks of ethanol exposure, which was not affected by thalidomide. moreover, thalidomide reduced the lps-induced tnf-alpha production by kcs by decreasing tnf-alpha messenger rna. conclusions: these results collectively indicate that thalidomide prevents alcoholic liver injury through suppression of tnf-alpha production and abolishment of kc sensitization.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ identification and characterization of a novel flavin-containing spermine oxidase of mammalian cell origin. during polyamine catabolism, spermine and spermidine are first acetylated by spermidine/spermine n(1)-acetyltransferase (ssat) and subsequently oxidized by polyamine oxidase (pao) to produce spermidine and putrescine, respectively. in attempting to clone the pao involved in this back-conversion pathway, we encountered an oxidase that preferentially cleaves spermine in the absence of prior acetylation by ssat. a blast search using maize pao sequences identified homologous mammalian cdnas derived from human hepatoma and mouse mammary carcinoma: the encoded proteins differed by 20 amino acids. when either cdna was transiently transfected into hek-293 cells, intracellular spermine pools decreased by 75% while spermidine and n (1)-acetylspermidine pools increased, suggesting that spermine was selectively and directly oxidized by the enzyme. substrate specificity using lysates of oxidase-transfected hek-293 cells revealed that the newly identified oxidase strongly favoured spermine over n (1)-acetylspermine and that it failed to act on n (1)-acetylspermidine, spermidine or the preferred pao substrate, n (1), n (12)-diacetylspermine. the pao inhibitor, mdl-72,527, only partially blocked oxidation of spermine while a previously reported pao substrate, n (1)-( n -octanesulphonyl)spermine, potently inhibited the reaction. overall, the data indicate that the enzyme represents a novel mammalian oxidase which, on the basis of substrate specificity, we have designated spermine oxidase in order to distinguish it from the pao involved in polyamine back-conversion. the identification of an enzyme capable of directly oxidizing spermine to spermidine has important implications for understanding polyamine homoeostasis and for interpreting metabolic and cellular responses to clinically relevant polyamine analogues and inhibitors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ toxic, halogenated cysteine s-conjugates and targeting of mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism. several haloalkenes are metabolized in part to nephrotoxic cysteine s-conjugates; for example, trichloroethylene and tetrafluoroethylene are converted to s-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (dcvc) and s-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-cysteine (tfec), respectively. although dcvc-induced toxicity has been investigated since the 1950s, the toxicity of tfec and other haloalkene-derived cysteine s-conjugates has been studied more recently. some segments of the us population are exposed to haloalkenes either through drinking water or in the workplace. therefore, it is important to define the toxicological consequences of such exposures. most halogenated cysteine s-conjugates are metabolized by cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases to pyruvate, ammonia, and an alpha-chloroenethiolate (with dcvc) or an alpha-difluoroalkylthiolate (with tfec) that may eliminate halide to give a thioacyl halide, which reacts with epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues in proteins. nine mammalian pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-containing enzymes catalyze cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase reactions, including mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mitaspat), and mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (bcat(m)). most of the cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyases are syncatalytically inactivated. tfec-induced toxicity is associated with covalent modification of several mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism. interestingly, the alpha-ketoglutarate- and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (kgdhc and bcdhc), but not the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdhc), are susceptible to inactivation. mitaspat and bcat(m) may form metabolons with kgdhc and bcdhc, respectively, but no plp enzyme is known to associate with pdhc. consequently, we hypothesize that not only do these metabolons facilitate substrate channeling, but they also facilitate toxicant channeling, thereby promoting the inactivation of proximate mitochondrial enzymes and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ organic cation transporter mrna and function in the rat superior cervical ganglion. reuptake of extracellular noradrenaline (na) into superior cervical ganglion (scg) neurones is mediated by means of the noradrenaline transporter (nat, uptake 1). we now demonstrate by single-cell rt-pcr that mrna of the organic cation transporter 3 (oct3, uptake 2) occurs in rat scg neurones as well. furthermore, our rt-pcr analyses reveal the presence of mrna for novel organic cation transporters 1 and 2 (octn1 and octn2), but not for oct1 or oct2 in the ganglion. making use of the nat as a powerful, neurone-specific transporter system, we loaded[3h]-n-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3h]-mpp+) into cultured rat scg neurones. the ensuing radioactive outflow from these cultures was enhanced by desipramine and reserpine, but reduced (in the presence of desipramine) by the oct3 inhibitors cyanine 863, oestradiol and corticosterone. in contrast, cyanine 863 enhanced the radioactive outflow from cultures preloaded with [3h]-na. two observations suggest that a depletion of storage vesicles by cyanine 863 accounts for the latter phenomenon: first, the primary radioactive product isolated from supernatants of cultures loaded with [3h]-na was the metabolite [3h]-dhpg; and second, inhibition of mao significantly reduced the radioactive outflow in response to cyanine 863. the outflow of [3h]-mpp+ was significantly enhanced by mpp+, guanidine, choline and amantadine as potential substrates for oct-related transmembrane transporters. however, desipramine at a low concentration essentially blocked the radioactive outflow induced by all of these substances with the exception of mpp+, indicating the nat and not an oct as their primary site of action. the mpp+-induced release of [3h]-mpp+ was fully prevented by a combined application of desipramine and cyanine 863. no trans-stimulation of [3h]-mpp+ outflow was observed by the octn1 and octn2 substrate carnitine at 100 microm. our observations indicate an oct-mediated transmembrane transport of [3h]-mpp+. amongst the three octs expressed in the scg, oct3 best fits the profile of substrates and antagonists that cause trans-stimulation and trans-inhibition, respectively, of [3h]-mpp+ release.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ activity of opioid ligands in cells expressing cloned mu opioid receptors. background: the aim of the present study was to describe the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only mu opioid receptors. receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (camp) production. efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand beta-endorphin and the common mu agonist, morphine. results: among the ligands studied naltrexone, win 44,441 and skf 10047, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. agonist efficacy was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated camp production. the rank order of efficacy of the agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone = beta-endorphin > etorphine = lofentanil = butorphanol = morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine = dezocine = metazocine >or= xorphanol. the rank order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies; etorphine > hydromorphone > dezocine > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > metazocine > nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>> beta-endorphin. conclusion: these results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at mu opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. furthermore, these results can assist in understanding the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through mu opioid receptors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ventricular tachyarrhythmias in a canine model of lqt3: arrhythmogenic effects of sympathetic activity and therapeutic effects of mexiletine. the ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with the lqt3 syndrome are typically bradycardia-dependent. however, some episodes can be associated with exercise or emotional stress, suggesting a different arrhythmogenic mechanism when sympathetic activity predominates. this study examined the potential arrhythmogenic mechanisms during periods of autonomically mediated transient heart rate acceleration in a canine anthopleurin-a model of lqt3 syndrome. using plunge needle electrodes, transmural unipolar electrograms of the left ventricle were recorded from endocardial (endo), mid-myocardial (mid) and epicardial (epi) sites. the activation-recovery interval (ari) was measured to estimate local refractoriness. the cardiac cycle length was gradually shortened by cessation of vagal stimulation (vagal stimulation protocol (vsp)), and intramural electrograms and onset mode of ventricular tachyarrhythmias were analyzed in 7 experiments. the vsp was performed 8 times before and 5 times after administration of mexiletine in each experiment. before mexiletine, vagal stimulation slowed the heart rate and created large transmural ari dispersion because of a greater ari prolongation at mid rather than epi/endo sites. after cessation of vagal stimulation, unipolar electrograms started to show ari alternans and ventricular premature beats developed sporadically. sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced in 12 of the 56 trials of the vsp. initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was associated with delayed conduction at mid/endo sites. mexiletine attenuated transmural ari dispersion, and neither ari alternans nor ventricular tachyarrhythmias was observed during all 35 trials of the vsp after mexiletine administration. heart rate acceleration induced by an abrupt shift to a state of predominant sympathetic activity enhances arrhythmias in this lqt3 model. mexiletine homogenizes ventricular repolarization, suppresses premature complexes and was antiarrhythmic during ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by the vsp.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ butyrylcholinesterase: an important new target in alzheimer's disease therapy. acetylcholinesterase (ache) predominates in the healthy brain, with butyrylcholinesterase (buche) considered to play a minor role in regulating brain acetylcholine (ach) levels. however, buche activity progressively increases in patients with alzheimer's disease (ad), while ache activity remains unchanged or declines. both enzymes therefore represent legitimate therapeutic targets for ameliorating the cholinergic deficit considered to be responsible for the declines in cognitive, behavioral and global functioning characteristic of ad. the two enzymes differ in substrate specificity, kinetics and activity in different brain regions. experimental evidence from the use of agents with enhanced selectivity for buche (cymserine analogues, mf-8622) and the dual inhibitor of both ache and buche, rivastigmine, indicates potential therapeutic benefits of inhibiting both ache and buche in ad and related dementias. recent evidence suggests that both ache and buche may have roles in the aetiology and progression of ad beyond regulation of synaptic ach levels. the development of specific buche inhibitors and further experience with the dual enzyme inhibitor rivastigmine will improve understanding of the aetiology of ad and should lead to a wider variety of potent treatment options.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ a low toxicity maintenance regime, using eicosapentaenoic acid and readily available drugs, for mantle cell lymphoma and other malignancies with excess cyclin d1 levels. mantle cell lymphoma is a difficult to treat non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl) whose biochemistry is unusually well characterised. almost all and perhaps all patients overexpress the cyclin d1 protein which is crucial in driving cells from the g1 to the s phase. this overexpression may be responsible for the refractoriness. despite this understanding, treatments for mantle cell lymphoma are based on standard nhl regimes of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone, perhaps supplemented with the monoclonal antibody rituximab. there has never been any attempt to direct treatment to the cyclin d1 mechanism or to angiogenesis which is now known to be important in all lymphomas. both these targets lend themselves to long-term maintenance regimes of relatively low toxicity which can be used as adjuvants to standard therapy. agents which have recently been shown to block cyclin d1 translation by regulating calcium levels are the unsaturated essential fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, and the antifungal agent, clotrimazole. two types of agent which have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis are the teratogen, thalidomide, and the selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (cox-2). retinoids exert synergistic effects with epa and have been shown to inhibit both tumour growth and angiogenesis. the mechanisms of action of these various agents are discussed, and specific suggestions are made for low toxicity maintenance therapy of mantle cell lymphoma and of other tumours which overexpress cyclin d1.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ angiotensin at1 receptor antagonist losartan and the defence reaction in the anaesthetised rat. effect on the carotid chemoreflex. modulation at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarii (nts) appears to be an effective way of controlling cardiovascular reflexes. angiotensin ii acting on angiotensin at1 receptors at the central nervous system appears to have an important role in these modulatory processes. the hypothalamic defence area (hda) is a potential source of descending fibres containing angiotensin ii that innervate the nts. we investigated the effect of at1 receptor blockade in the nts on the response to stimulation of hda in anaesthetised rats treated with the neuromuscular blocking agent pancuronium bromide. the characteristic increase in heart rate, blood pressure and phrenic nerve activity evoked by electrical stimulation of hda is decreased by the microinjection of the at1 receptor antagonist losartan into the nts and the cardiovascular response to carotid body chemical stimulation is also reduced. these results support the hypothesis that at1 receptors in the nts play a role in the modulation of cardiovascular reflexes, and modify the influence exerted on the processing of these reflexes by other areas of the central nervous system.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ defective processing of the transforming growth factor-beta1 in azoxymethane-induced mouse colon tumors. high levels of the cell growth inhibitor transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1) are often found in a variety of human cancers. however, the physiological significance of this overexpression depends on the availability of the biologically active form of tgf-beta1 within the extracellular matrix of the tumor microenvironment. to determine the expression and activation status of tgf-beta1 in chemically induced tumors, 6-wk-old a/j mice were injected intraperitoneally with either azoxymethane (aom) (10 mg/kg body weight, once a week for 6 wk) or normal saline solution, and colon tumors were isolated 24 wk following the last injection. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for tgf-beta1 revealed a significant increase (1.7-fold, p < 0.05) in total tgf-beta1 protein in tumors. interestingly, while 80% of the total tgf-beta1 in the control colon tissues was in the active form, only 50% was found to be active in tumors. together with our earlier observations that tgf-beta1 mrna levels are unchanged in a/j tumors, these data further support a mechanism whereby elevated tgf-beta1 levels result from a defective activation and turnover of this protein. because plasmin is known to be a major activator of tgf-beta1 in vivo, we hypothesized that reduced plasmin activity may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of tgf-beta1 processing in these behaviorally benign tumors. with a fluorogenic peptide substrate for serine proteases, a deficiency in plasmin activity was found in the tumors. furthermore, semiquantitative reverse transcription (rt)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis of a panel of genes involved in the plasminogen activation system, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1), urokinase-plasminogen activator (u-pa), and urokinase-receptor (u-par-1), demonstrated a significant upregulation (approximately fourfold to sixfold, p < 0.05) in the expression of each of these genes in the tumor tissue. in addition, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of thrombospondin-1 (tsp-1) and insulin-like growth factor type ii receptor (igf-iir), which also mediate the activation of latent tgf-beta1. to gain further insight into the functionality of the tgf-beta1 pathway, cdna microarrays were performed and the expression levels of a panel of 21 tgf-beta1-specific target genes were determined in aom-induced tumors that overexpress the ligand. a significant dysregulation in the expression of each of these targets was observed, providing evidence of aberrant tgf-beta1 signaling in tumors. overall, the present study demonstrates a very low plasmin activity in a/j colon tumors, possibly as a result of the potent inhibitory effect of pai-1 on the plasminogen activation cascade. the observed deficiency in plasmin activity may not be sufficiently compensated for by other mechanisms of latent tgf-beta1 activation, including tsp-1 and igf-iir, thereby resulting in a decreased fraction of the biologically active form of tgf-beta1 and subsequent aberration in tgf-beta1-specific gene regulation in a/j tumors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ inhibition by pentosan polysulfate (pps) of heparin-binding growth factors released from tumor cells and blockage by pps of tumor growth in animals. background: in a proliferating tumor, locally secreted polypeptide growth factors, which have autocrine and paracrine functions, induce vascularization essential for tumor growth and metastasis. these growth factors may serve as targets for tumor therapy. we have shown that the heparinoid pentosan polysulfate (pps) can block growth of subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude mice and angiogenesis induced by the heparin-binding, kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (k-fgf). purpose: the purpose of this study was to determine whether pps might also interfere with stimulation of endothelial cells by other growth factors released from tumor cells and whether the promising antitumor effects of pps extend to other human tumor cell lines. we studied the effects of pps on stimulation by heparin-binding growth factors released from seven human tumor cell lines in vitro and on tumors growing from these cell lines in athymic nude mice. methods: seven human cell lines established from breast, prostate, epidermoid, and lung carcinomas and rhabdomyosarcoma were used in in vivo as well as in vitro studies of the effects of pps. we also studied in vitro the effects of pps on growth factor-induced colony formation of normal rat kidney fibroblasts and human adrenal carcinoma cells. results: the tumor cell lines released growth factors into their media that stimulated growth of endothelial and epithelial cells as well as fibroblasts. heparin-affinity chromatography showed that heparin-binding growth factors contributed substantially to this paracrine activity and that pps inhibited this stimulus. six of the seven tumor cell lines were resistant to pps in soft-agar cloning assays and hence did not appear to depend on autocrine stimulation by the heparin-binding growth factors. in contrast to this in vitro resistance, subcutaneous growth of tumors from all cell lines in athymic nude mice was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by daily intraperitoneal injections of pps. conclusions: we conclude that heparin-binding growth factors contribute substantially to tumor growth in vivo and that pps acts by blocking the paracrine effects of heparin-binding growth factors released from the tumor cells. implication: pps could become a novel treatment tool targeting tumor growth factors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ use of the norepinephrine transporter as a reporter gene for non-invasive imaging of genetically modified cells. background: the norepinephrine transporter (net) is a high-affinity transporter for catecholamines. its expression is almost exclusively restricted to the sympathetic nervous system. in this study we evaluated whether the net can be used as a reporter gene for non-invasive imaging of genetically modified cells with radiolabeled probes. methods: human a431, ht1080 and murine cms-5 cells were retrovirally transduced with bovine net cdna. transduced and parental cells were incubated in vitro with [(131)i]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([(131)i]mibg). the specificity of tracer uptake was determined by adding the net inhibitor imipramine. rat pc12 cells served as positive controls. parental and a431net cells were xenotransplanted into nude mice and tumor uptake of [(123)i]mibg in vivo was determined after tracer administration. results: in vitro stably transduced cells showed a 66- to 120-fold higher [(131)i]mibg uptake than parental cells. incubation with imipramine reduced [(131)i]mibg uptake of transduced cells to the level found in parental cells. more than 70% of the initial radioactivity was retained in all transduced cell lines after 2 h incubation with tracer-free medium. [(131)i]mibg uptake in pc12 cells, which express the net endogenously, was 20- to 28-fold lower than in transduced cells. in vivo, a431net tumors demonstrated a 33-fold higher [(123)i]mibg uptake than parental tumors. gamma camera images 24 h after tracer injection showed no tracer uptake in parental a431 tumors, but clear images of a431net tumors. conclusions: transduction of tumor cells with net cdna causes highly specific uptake and significant retention of catecholamine analogs in vitro and in vivo. these characteristics make the net suitable as a reporter gene for non-invasive monitoring of gene transfer.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ comparative pharmacology of human beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes--characterization of stably transfected receptors in cho cells. although many beta1-receptor antagonists and beta2-receptor agonists have been used in pharmacotherapy for many years their pharmacological properties at all three known subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors are not always well characterized. the aim of this study was, therefore, to provide comparative binding characteristics of agonists (epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, fenoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol, terbutalin, formoterol, broxaterol) and antagonists (propranolol, alprenolol, atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, pindolol, brl 37344, cgp 20712, sr 59230a, cgp 12177, ici 118551) at all three subtypes of human beta-adrenergic receptors in an identical cellular background. we generated chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells stably expressing the three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes at comparable levels. we characterized these receptor subtypes and analyzed the affinity of routinely used drugs as well as experimental compounds in competition binding studies, using the non-selective antagonist 125i-cyanopindolol as a radioligand. furthermore, we analyzed the beta-receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity in isolated membranes from these cell lines. the results from our experiments show that all compounds exhibit distinct patterns of selectivity and activity at the three beta-receptor subtypes. in particular, a number of beta2- or beta3-receptor agonists that are inverse agonists at the other subtypes were identified. in addition, beta1-receptor antagonists with agonistic activity at beta2- and beta3-receptors were found. these specific mixtures of agonism, antagonism, and inverse agonism at different subtypes may have important implications for the therapeutic use of the respective compounds.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ocular hypotensive fp prostaglandin (pg) analogs: pg receptor subtype binding affinities and selectivities, and agonist potencies at fp and other pg receptors in cultured cells. natural prostaglandins (pgs) such as pgd2, pge2, pgf2(2alpha), and pgi2 exhibited the highest affinity for their respective cognate receptors, but were the least selective agents when tested in receptor binding assays. travoprost acid ([+]-fluprostenol) was the most fp-receptor-selective compound, exhibiting a high affinity (ki = 35 +/- 5 nm) for the fp receptor, and minimal affinity for dp (ki = 52,000 nm), ep1 (ki = 9540 nm), ep3 (ki = 3501 nm), ep4 (ki = 41,000 nm), ip (ki > 90,000 nm), and tp (ki = 121,000 nm) receptors. travoprost acid was the most potent pg analog tested in fp receptor functional phosphoinositide turnover assays in the following cell types: human ciliary muscle (ec50 = 1.4 nm), human trabecular meshwork (ec50 = 3.6 nm), and mouse fibroblasts and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ec50 = 2.6 nm). although latanoprost acid exhibited a relatively high affinity for the fp receptor (ki = 98 nm), it had significant functional activity at fp (ec50 = 32-124 nm) and ep1 (ec50 = 119 nm) receptors. bimatoprost acid was less selective, exhibiting a relatively high affinity for the fp (ki = 83 nm), ep1 (ki = 95 nm), and ep3 (ki = 387 nm) receptors. bimatoprost acid exhibited functional activity at the ep1 (ec50 = 2.7 nm) and fp (ec50 = 2.8-3.8 nm in most cells) receptors. bimatoprost (nonhydrolyzed amide) also behaved as an fp agonist at the cloned human fp receptor (ec50 = 681 nm), in h-tm (ec50 = 3245 nm) and other cell types. unoprostone and s-1033 bound with low affinity (ki = 5.9 microm to > 22 microm) to the fp receptor, were not selective, but activated the fp receptor. in conclusion, travoprost acid has the highest affinity, the highest fp-receptor-selectivity, and the highest potency at the fp receptor as compared to the other ocular hypotensive pg analogs known so far, including free acids of latanoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone isopropyl ester.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ loss of beta-adrenoceptor response in myocytes overexpressing the na+/ca(2+)-exchanger. increased na+/ca(2+)-exchanger (ncx) and altered beta-adrenoceptor (betaar) responses are observed in failing human heart. to determine the possible interaction between these changes, we investigated the effect of ncx overexpression on responses to isoproterenol in adult rat ventricular myocytes. responses to isoproterenol were largely mediated through the beta1ar in control myocytes. adenovirally-mediated overexpression of ncx, at levels, which did not alter basal contraction of myocytes, markedly depressed the isoproterenol concentration-response curve. responses to isoproterenol could be restored to normal by beta2ar blockade, suggesting a beta2ar-mediated inhibition of beta1ar signalling. pertussis toxin normalised isoproterenol responses in ncx cells, indicating that beta2ar effects were mediated by gi. negative-inotropic effects of high concentrations of ici 118,551, previously shown to be due to beta2ar-gi coupling, were increased in ncx cells. we conclude that ncx upregulation can markedly alter the consequences of betaar stimulation and that this may contribute to the alterations in betaar response seen in failing human heart.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ effects of the egfr/her2 kinase inhibitor gw572016 on egfr- and her2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line proliferation, radiosensitization, and resistance. purpose: two members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, egfr and her2, have been implicated in radioresistance in breast cancer and other malignancies. to gauge the potential clinical utility of targeting both egfr and her2 to control growth and radiosensitize human breast cancers, we examined the effect of a dual egfr/her2 inhibitor, gw572016, on the proliferation and radiation response of either egfr- or her2-overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines. methods and materials: primary human breast cancer cell lines that endogenously overexpress egfr or her2 and luminal mammary epithelial h16n2 cells stably transfected with her2 were evaluated for the effect of gw572016 on inhibition of ligand-induced or constitutive receptor phosphorylation, proliferation, radiosensitization, and inhibition of downstream signaling. results: gw572016 inhibited constitutive and/or ligand-induced egfr or her2 tyrosine phosphorylation of all five cell lines, which correlated with the antiproliferative response in all but one cell line. gw572016 radiosensitized egfr-overexpressing cell lines, but her2-overexpressing cells were unable to form colonies after brief exposure to gw572016 even in the absence of radiation, and thus could not be evaluated for radiosensitization. one cell line was resistant to the antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of gw572016, despite receptor inhibition. exploration of potential mechanisms of resistance in sum185 cells revealed failure of gw572016 to inhibit downstream erk and akt activation, despite inhibition of her2 phosphorylation. in contrast, sensitive her2-overexpressing cell lines demonstrated inhibition of both erk and akt phosphorylation. conclusion: gw572016 potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation in either egfr- or her2-overexpressing cell lines and has both antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects. resistance to gw572016 was not due to a lack of receptor inhibition, but rather with a lack of inhibition of erk and akt, suggesting that measurement of inhibition of crucial signaling pathways may better predict response than inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. the sum185 cell line provides a valuable model for studying mechanisms of resistance of egfr/her2 inhibitor therapy.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ aquaporin-1 deletion reduces osmotic water permeability and cerebrospinal fluid production. aquaporin-1 (aqp1) is a water channel that is strongly expressed at the ventricular-facing surface of choroid plexus epithelium. using wildtype and aqp1 null mice, we developed novel methods to compare the water permeability in isolated choroid plexus, and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) production in living mice. osmotically-induced water transport was rapid in freshly isolated choroid plexus from wildtype mice as measured by a spatial-filtering optical method, and reduced by 5-fold by aqp1 deletion. csf production, an isosmolar fluid secretion process, was measured by a dye dilution method involving fluid collections using a second microneedle introduced into the cisterna magna. csf production in wildtype mice was (in microl/min) 0.37 +/- 0.04 microl/min (control), 0.16 +/- 0.03 microl/min (acetazolamide-treated) and 1.14 +/- 0.15 microl/min (forskolin-treated), and reduced by up to 25% in aqp1 null mice. the impaired csf production in aqp1 null mice provides direct functional evidence for the involvement of aqp1 in csf formation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ metformin, but not leptin, regulates amp-activated protein kinase in pancreatic islets: impact on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. metformin, a drug widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has recently been shown to act on skeletal muscle and liver in part through the activation of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk). whether metformin or the satiety factor leptin, which also stimulates ampk in muscle, regulates this enzyme in pancreatic islets is unknown. we have recently shown that forced increases in ampk activity inhibit insulin secretion from min6 cells (da silva xavier g, leclerc i, varadi a, tsuboi t, moule sk, and rutter ga. biochem j 371: 761-774, 2003). here, we explore whether 1) glucose, metformin, or leptin regulates ampk activity in isolated islets from rodent and human and 2) whether changes in ampk activity modulate insulin secretion from human islets. increases in glucose concentration from 0 to 3 and from 3 to 17 mm inhibited ampk activity in primary islets from mouse, rat, and human, confirming previous findings in insulinoma cells. incubation with metformin (0.2-1 mm) activated ampk in both human islets and min6 beta-cells in parallel with an inhibition of insulin secretion, whereas leptin (10-100 nm) was without effect in min6 cells. these studies demonstrate that ampk activity is subject to regulation by both glucose and metformin in pancreatic islets and clonal beta-cells. the inhibitory effects of metformin on insulin secretion may therefore need to be considered with respect to the use of this drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ a novel retinoic acid-responsive element regulates retinoic acid-induced blr1 expression. the mechanism of action of retinoic acid (ra) is of broad relevance to cell and developmental biology, nutrition, and cancer chemotherapy. ra is known to induce expression of the burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (blr1) gene which propels ra-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation of hl-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells, motivating the present analysis of transcriptional regulation of blr1 expression by ra. the ra-treated hl-60 cells used here expressed all ra receptor (rar) and retinoid x receptor (rxr) subtypes (as detected by northern analysis) except rxrgamma. treatment with rar- and rxr-selective ligands showed that raralpha synergized with rxralpha to transcriptionally activate blr1 expression. a 5'-flanking region capable of supporting ra-induced blr1 activation in hl-60 cells was found to contain a 205-bp sequence in the distal portion that was necessary for transcriptional activation by ra. within this sequence dnase i footprinting revealed that ra induced binding of a nuclear protein complex to an element containing two gt boxes. electromobility shift assays (emsas) and supershift assays showed that this element bound recombinant raralpha and rxralpha. without ra there was neither complex binding nor transcriptional activation. both gt boxes were needed for binding the complex, and mutation of either gt box caused the loss of transcriptional activation by ra. the ability of this cis-acting rar-rxr binding element to activate transcription in response to ra also depended on downstream sequences where an octamer transcription factor 1 (oct1) site and a nuclear factor of activated t cells (nfatc) site between this element and the transcriptional start, as well as a cyclic amp response element binding factor (creb) site between the transcriptional start and first exon of the blr1 gene, were necessary. each of these sites bound its corresponding transcription factor. a transcription factor-transcription factor binding array analysis of nuclear lysate from ra-treated cells indicated several prominent raralpha binding partners; among these, oct1, nfatc3, and creb2 were identified by competition emsa and supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays as components of the complex. ra upregulated expression of these three factors. in sum the results of the present study indicate that ra-induced expression of blr1 expression depends on a novel ra response element. this cis-acting element approximately 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start consists of two gt boxes that bind rar and rxr in a nuclear protein complex that also contains oct1, nfatc3, and creb2 bound to their cognate downstream consensus binding sites.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the persistent membrane retention of desipramine causes lasting inhibition of norepinephrine transporter function. the present study examined the potential membrane retention of desipramine (dmi) following exposures of 293-hnet cells to dmi, and its effect on [3h]ne uptake. incubation of cells with 500 nm dmi for 1 h or 1 day persistently inhibited the uptake of [3h]ne up to 7 days, despite daily repeated washing of cells with drug-free medium. uptake inhibition was paralleled by persistent retention of dmi associated with cells, as determined by hplc and by radiotracer experiments using [3h]dmi. [3h]dmi trapped in membranes was displaceable by the structurally unrelated net inhibitor, nisoxetine, in a concentration-dependent manner, implying interaction of retained [3h]dmi with the net. a similar cellular retention was observed following incubation of cells with nisoxetine. the results demonstrate that dmi and nisoxetine are persistently retained in cell membranes, at least partly in association with the net. the retention and slow diffusion of dmi and nisoxetine from membranes may contribute to their pharmacological and modulatory action on net.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ at1-receptor antagonism in hypertension: what has been learned with irbesartan? irbesartan is a long-acting angiotensin ii antagonist acting specifically at the level of the type 1-receptor subtype (at1-receptor). this compound lowers blood pressure dose-dependently in hypertensive patients and has a placebo-like tolerability. the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan is greatly enhanced by the coadministration of a diuretic, and fixed-dose combinations of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are now available. irbesartan-based treatment appears especially effective for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, renal disease and cardiac hypertrophy. in patients with type 2 diabetes, irbesartan delays the development of nephropathy as well as the progression of renal failure. irbesartan may have antiatherosclerotic properties beyond those expected from blood pressure lowering per se: this at1-blocker decreases the vascular oxidative stress and prevents the procoagulant as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin ii. irbesartan given alone or in combination with a diuretic therefore represents a rational approach to treat hypertensive patients.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ binding of (-)-[3h]-cgp12177 at two sites in recombinant human beta 1-adrenoceptors and interaction with beta-blockers. to verify the hypothesis that the non-conventional partial agonist (-)-cgp12177 binds at two beta(1)-adrenoceptor sites, human beta(1)-adrenoceptors, expressed in cho cells, were labelled with (-)-[(3)h]-cgp12177. we compared the binding affinity and antagonist potency of 12 clinically used beta-blockers against the cyclic amp-enhancing effects of (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-cgp12177.(-)-[(3)h]-cgp12177 bound to a high affinity site (h; k(h)=0.47 nm) and low affinity site (l); k(l)=235 nm). (-)-[(3)h]-cgp12177 dissociated from the beta(1)-adrenoceptors with a fast component (k(off)=0.45 min(-1)), consistent with the l-site, and a slow component (k(off)=0.017-0.033 min(-1)), consistent with the h-site. (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-cgp12177 caused 96-fold and 12-fold maximal increases in cyclic amp levels with -logec(50)m of 8.2 and 7.6. (-)-cgp12177 antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline with a pk(b) of 9.9. the beta-blockers antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline more than the effects of (-)-cgp12177 with potency ratios: (-)-atenolol 1,000, (+/-)-metropolol 676, (-)-pindolol 631, (-)-timolol 589, (+/-)-carvedilol 204, (+/-)-oxprenolol 138, (+/-)-sotalol 132, (-)-propranolol 120, (+/-)-bisoprolol 95, (+/-)-alprenolol 81, (+/-)-nadolol 68 and (-)-bupranolol 56. in intact cells the binding constants of beta-blockers, estimated from competition with 3-5 nm (-)-[(3)h]-cgp12177 (binding to the h-site), correlated with the corresponding affinities estimated from antagonism of the (-)-isoprenaline effects. we conclude that (-)-[(3)h]-cgp12177 binds at two sites in the recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptor. (-)-cgp12177 is an antagonist of catecholamine effects through the h-site and a non-conventional partial agonist through the l-site. beta-blockers are more potent antagonists through the h-site than the l-site.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ imiquimod, a toll-like receptor-7 agonist, induces perforin in cytotoxic t lymphocytes in vitro. imiquimod (imq), an activator of toll-like receptor-7 (tlr-7), induces by several routes a profound anti-viral and anti-tumor effect in vivo. physiologically, the immune system is using perforin-containing granules of cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) towards the same biological purpose. this functional synergism prompted our current experiments addressing the question whether imq may influence perforin-release and/or induce perforin in ctls in vitro. in peripheral lymphocytes of healthy and diseased subjects, imq induced a significant increase of perforin(+) ctls within 12h in all experiments performed. this effect was most pronounced in ctls of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, a model disorder for subnormal perforin expression: as compared to perforin(+) ctls detected at time point zero (100%), up to 270% of perforin(+) ctls were induced by 2.5 microg/ml [corrected] imq. perforin release from peripheral blood ctls after pma/ionomycin-stimulation was not influenced significantly by imq. thus, the biological activity of imq appears to exceed its previously known functions, inasmuch as it boosts up significantly the perforin-granule system.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action. the popularity of caffeine as a psychoactive drug is due to its stimulant properties, which depend on its ability to reduce adenosine transmission in the brain. adenosine a(1) and a(2a) receptors are expressed in the basal ganglia, a group of structures involved in various aspects of motor control. caffeine acts as an antagonist to both types of receptors. increasing evidence indicates that the psychomotor stimulant effect of caffeine is generated by affecting a particular group of projection neurons located in the striatum, the main receiving area of the basal ganglia. these cells express high levels of adenosine a(2a) receptors, which are involved in various intracellular processes, including the expression of immediate early genes and regulation of the dopamine- and cyclic amp-regulated 32-kda phosphoprotein darpp-32. the present review focuses on the effects of caffeine on striatal signal transduction and on their involvement in caffeine-mediated motor stimulation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ clinical assessment of norepinephrine transporter blockade through biochemical and pharmacological profiles. background: to assess the sensitivity of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological markers of peripheral norepinephrine (ne) transporter (net) function, we chronically antagonized net by a range of doses of duloxetine [(+)-n-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2 thiophenepropanamine], which blocks the ne reuptake process. methods and results: duloxetine was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers. plasma from duloxetine-treated subjects (ex vivo effect) dose-dependently decreased radioligand binding to human net (maximum inhibition was 60%) (p=0.02). the dose of intravenous tyramine required to raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mm hg (pd30) increased dose-dependently with duloxetine and was significant at the end of the 120-mg/d dosage (p<0.001). the plasma dihydoxyphenylglycol to ne (dhpg/ne) ratio was reduced significantly at 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (11.3 at baseline, 3.4 at 240 mg/d, p<0.001). plasma ne was significantly increased starting at 120 mg/d duloxetine. urine results (corrected for 24-hour creatinine excretion) showed a dose-dependent change from the baseline urinary excretion for ne, dhpg, and the dhpg/ne ratio. the most sensitive measure, the dhpg/ne ratio, was significant at the 80-mg dose. urinary ne excretion was significantly raised after 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (p<0.001), the lowest dose used in the study. conclusions: these findings suggest that the degree of net blockade can be assessed with the plasma or urine dhpg/ne ratio and the pressor effect of tyramine. also, the dhpg/ne ratio is more sensitive at the lower end of net inhibition, whereas tyramine exhibits a linear relation, with net inhibition commencing at a higher dose.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ auranofin increases apoptosis and ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the rat isolated heart. auranofin, an antirheumatic gold compound, is an inhibitor of selenocysteine enzymes, such as thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase. these enzymes play an important role in protecting cardiac tissue from oxidative stress generated during ischaemia-reperfusion. auranofin (100 mg/kg) was administered to rats and their hearts were subjected to an in vitro model of ischaemia-reperfusion. the activity of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase was determined in liver and heart tissues in an attempt to correlate enzymatic activity with heart recovery after ischaemia-reperfusion. there was significantly less thioredoxin reductase activity in rat liver extracts, whereas the level of glutathione activity remained unchanged, demonstrating that the dose of auranofin used was able to selectively inhibit one of these enzyme systems. rats administered auranofin displayed significantly impaired recovery from ischaemic insult. the end diastolic pressure was increased, whereas the rate pressure product was significantly decreased. the level of postischaemic apoptosis was also assessed by examining caspase-3 activity in tissue homogenates. auranofin significantly increased the degree of postischaemic apoptosis, leading to poor postischaemic recovery.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ gallium and other main group metal compounds as antitumor agents. gallium has been the second metal to show activity against malignant tumors in humans soon after the establishment of platinum drugs in routine clinical practice. it has the unique property of inhibiting tumor growth as a simple cation, mainly because of its close resemblance to ferric iron. even though its inability to shift between the trivalent and a divalent oxidation state precludes that gallium behaves as an iron analogue in every respect, it strongly interferes with cellular acquisition of iron from blood by competitive interaction with transferrin and transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis. furthermore, gallium also seems to affect intracellular availability of iron already taken up via this pathway, probably due to its inhibitory activity on vacuolar-type h(+)-atpases. apart from the consequences of iron deprivation, gallium exerts cytotoxic effects by direct interaction with the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in reduced dntp pools and inhibition of dna synthesis. both the abundance of transferrin receptors and upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase render tumors susceptible to gallium-induced cytotoxicity. however, some experimental findings raise the question whether these effects resulting from the iron-mimicking properties of gallium are solely responsible for its antineoplastic activity or whether additional mechanisms are involved, such as antimitotic effects which result from its capability of inhibiting tubulin polymerization. the limitations experienced with gallium nitrate and gallium chloride, which call for a prolonged exposure to low steady-state gallium levels in blood in order to adequately exploit the affinity of gallium to tumor tissues and to avoid severe toxic effects, may be overcome by oral gallium complexes such as tris(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4h-pyran-4-onato)gallium(iii) (gallium maltolate) or tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(iii) (kp46), which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and show promise to initiate a revival of gallium in the clinical setting. these two investigational drugs, albeit differing in their complex stability, have both been developed with the intention of providing gallium in a form which allows sufficient intestinal absorption, but without altering its pharmacodynamic effects. gallium complexes based on other rationales are scarce and, with regard to the well-known antineoplastic potential of this metal, noticeably under-explored. with the recent approval of arsenic trioxide for the second-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the clinical revival of arsenic compounds, which have been the mainstay of antileukemic therapy before the age of modern cancer chemotherapy, has already begun. currently, strong efforts are being made to explore the activity spectrum in other (less rare) malignancies and to gain a deeper insight into the mode of action. although this development is currently focusing on arsenic trioxide, it should be suited to stimulate investigations into the therapeutic potential of other arsenic compounds as well.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the synaptic vesicle protein sv2a is the binding site for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. here, we show that the synaptic vesicle protein sv2a is the brain binding site of levetiracetam (lev), a new antiepileptic drug with a unique activity profile in animal models of seizure and epilepsy. the lev-binding site is enriched in synaptic vesicles, and photoaffinity labeling of purified synaptic vesicles confirms that it has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 90 kda. brain membranes and purified synaptic vesicles from mice lacking sv2a do not bind a tritiated lev derivative, indicating that sv2a is necessary for lev binding. lev and related compounds bind to sv2a expressed in fibroblasts, indicating that sv2a is sufficient for lev binding. no binding was observed to the related isoforms sv2b and sv2c. furthermore, there is a high degree of correlation between binding affinities of a series of lev derivatives to sv2a in fibroblasts and to the lev-binding site in brain. finally, there is a strong correlation between the affinity of a compound for sv2a and its ability to protect against seizures in an audiogenic mouse animal model of epilepsy. these experimental results suggest that sv2a is the binding site of lev in the brain and that lev acts by modulating the function of sv2a, supporting previous indications that lev possesses a mechanism of action distinct from that of other antiepileptic drugs. further, these results indicate that proteins involved in vesicle exocytosis, and sv2 in particular, are promising targets for the development of new cns drug therapies.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ thymidylate synthase: a critical target in cancer therapy? for the last four decades, synthesis and testing of potentially active drugs (e.g., antimetabolites) have focused on structural modification of existing metabolites as precursors of dna and rna synthesis. in recent years, the focus has shifted to synthesis of target-specific agents. thus, the current emphasis of drug development is directed at inhibiting specific target(s) expressed preferentially, if not exclusively, in tumor tissues, with the ultimate goal of improving the therapeutic efficacy and selectivity of these new agents. preclinically, proof-of-principle studies were carried out in tumors with specific expression of the intended target. with the hope of translating preclinical findings to the design of implementation of clinical trials. thymidylate synthase (ts) continues to be a critical target for 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and its prodrugs, uft/lv (orzel), capecitabine (xeloda), and s-1, primarily because this enzyme is essential for the synthesis of 2-deoxythymidine-5-monophosphate, a precursor for dna synthesis. while fluoropyrimidine antimetabolites have other sites of action, antifolates zd1694 (raltitrexed, tomudex) and ag337 (thymitag) are more specific and potent ts inhibitors. thus, it is hoped that pronounced and sustained inhibition of this enzyme could result in downstream regulation of molecular markers associated with sensitivity and resistance to these agents. it is also critical to recognize that the degree and duration of inhibition of the target enzyme may depend on the expression level of the target enzyme, thymidylate synthase. correlative studies in preclinical and clinical systems demonstrated a close relationship between the enzyme level (mrna and protein) and response to therapy of colorectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine or tomudex. however, significant overlap was demonstrated between responders and non-responders. these data are consistent with the hypothesis that prediction of response to anticancer drugs is multifactorial, and ts is one target. clinically, although overall response of colorectal cancer patients to a variety of ts inhibitors is similar, toxicity profiles are different. the availability of the 5-fu prodrugs offers the possibility of greater therapeutic selectivity based on the demonstration that thymidine phosphorylase, the activating enzyme for 5-fu, is expressed at a higher level in tumor tissue compared with normal tissue counterparts. it is likely that successful application of ts inhibitors will not only be based on measurement of the ts level in tumors vs. normal tissues, but on the delineation of the consequences of this inhibition on molecular markers associated with cellular proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ the dextromethorphan analog dimemorfan attenuates kainate-induced seizures via sigma1 receptor activation: comparison with the effects of dextromethorphan. in a previous study, we demonstrated that a dextromethorphan analog, dimemorfan, has neuroprotective effects. dextromethorphan and dimemorfan are high-affinity ligands at sigma1 receptors. dextromethorphan has moderate affinities for phencyclidine sites, while dimemorfan has very low affinities for such sites, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the anticonvulsant actions of dimemorfan. kainate (ka) administration (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) produced robust convulsions lasting 4-6 h in rats. pre-treatment with dimemorfan (12 or 24 mg kg(-1)) reduced seizures in a dose-dependent manner. dimemorfan pre-treatment also attenuated the ka-induced increases in c-fos/c-jun expression, activator protein (ap)-1 dna-binding activity, and loss of cells in the ca1 and ca3 fields of the hippocampus. these effects of dimemorfan were comparable to those of dextromethorphan. the anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan was significantly counteracted by a selective sigma1 receptor antagonist bd 1047, suggesting that the anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan is, at least in part, related to sigma1 receptor-activated modulation of ap-1 transcription factors. we asked whether dimemorfan produces the behavioral side effects seen with dextromethorphan or dextrorphan (a phencyclidine-like metabolite of dextromethorphan). conditioned place preference and circling behaviors were significantly increased in mice treated with phencyclidine, dextrorphan or dextromethorphan, while mice treated with dimemorfan showed no behavioral side effects. our results suggest that dimemorfan is equipotent to dextromethorphan in preventing ka-induced seizures, while it may lack behavioral effects, such as psychotomimetic reactions.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ binding domains of the oxytocin receptor for the selective oxytocin receptor antagonist barusiban in comparison to the agonists oxytocin and carbetocin. we have analyzed binding domains of the oxytocin receptor for barusiban, a highly selective oxytocin receptor antagonist, in comparison to the combined vasopressin v1a/oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban and the agonists oxytocin and carbetocin. for this purpose, chimeric 'gain-in function' oxytocin/vasopressin v2 receptors were expressed in cos-7 cells. these recombinant receptors have been produced by transfer of domains from the oxytocin receptor into the related vasopressin v2 receptor and have already been successfully employed for the identification of ligand binding domains at the oxytocin receptor (postina, r., kojro, e., fahrenholz, f., 1996. separate agonist and peptide antagonist binding sites of the oxytocin receptor defined by their transfer into the v2 vasopressin receptor. j. biol. chem. 271, 31593-31601). in displacement studies with 10 chimeric receptor constructs, the binding profile of barusiban was compared with the binding profiles of the ligands oxytocin, [arg8]vasopressin, carbetocin, and atosiban. the binding profiles for the agonists oxytocin and carbetocin were found to be similar. for both agonists, important binding domains were the extracellular n-terminus (=e1) and the extracellular loops e2 and e3 from the oxytocin receptor. for the vasopressin v1a/oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban, none of the receptor constructs were able to provide a binding with higher affinity than the starting vasopressin v2 receptor. in contrast, the binding of barusiban was significantly improved when the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 were transferred from the oxytocin receptor to the vasopressin v2 receptor. the binding domain of barusiban differs from the binding domain of the agonists and the nonselective oxytocin receptor antagonist d(ch2)5[tyr-(me)2,thr4,orn8,tyr9]vasotocin that has been used in previous studies. overall, the data supported the concept of a central pocket site within the oxytocin receptor.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ rapid quantitation of plasma 2'-deoxyuridine by high-performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry and its application to pharmacodynamic studies in cancer patients. a novel method employing high-performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) has been developed and validated for the quantitation of plasma 2'-deoxyuridine (udr). it involves a plasma clean-up step with strong anion-exchange solid-phase extraction (sax-spe) followed by hplc separation and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry detection (apci-ms) in a selected-ion monitoring (sim) mode. the ionization conditions were optimised in negative ion mode to give the best intensity of the dominant formate adduct [m+hcoo]- at m/z 273. retention times were 7.5 and 12.5 min for 2'-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, an iodinated analogue internal standard (is), respectively. peak area ratios of 2'-deoxyuridine to is were used for regression analysis of the calibration curve. the latter was linear from 5 to 400 nmol/l using 1 ml sample volume of plasma. the average recovery was 81.5% and 78.6% for 2'-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-deoxyuridine, respectively. the method provides sufficient sensitivity, precision, accuracy and selectivity for routine analysis of human plasma 2'-deoxyuridine concentration with the lowest limit of quantitation (lloq) of 5 nmol/l. clinical studies in cancer patients treated with the new fluoropyrimidine analogue capecitabine (n4-pentoxycarbonyl-5'-5-fluorocytidine) have shown that plasma 2'-deoxyuridine was significantly elevated after 1 week of treatment, consistent with inhibition of thymidylate synthase (ts). these findings suggest that the mechanism of antiproliferative toxicity of capecitabine is at least partly due to ts inhibitory activity of its active metabolite 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (fdump). monitoring of plasma udr concentrations have the potential to help clinicians to guide scheduling of capecitabine or other ts inhibitors in clinical trials. marked differences of plasma 2'-deoxyuridine between human and rodents have also been confirmed. in conclusion, the lc-ms method developed is simple, highly selective and sensitive and permits pharmacodynamic studies of ts inhibitors in several species.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(r)-roscovitine (cyc202, seliciclib) is a relatively selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), currently evaluated for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, renal diseases, and several viral infections. affinity chromatography investigations have shown that (r)-roscovitine also interacts with pdxk. to understand this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of pdxk in complex with (r)-roscovitine, n6-methyl-(r)-roscovitine, and o6-(r)-roscovitine, the two latter derivatives being designed to bind to pdxk but not to cdks. structural analysis revealed that these three roscovitines bind similarly in the pyridoxal-binding site of pdxk rather than in the anticipated atp-binding site. the pyridoxal pocket has thus an unexpected ability to accommodate molecules different from and larger than pyridoxal. this work provides detailed structural information on the interactions between pdxk and roscovitine and analogs. it could also aid in the design of roscovitine derivatives displaying strict selectivity for either pdxk or cdks.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ losartan: a selective angiotensin ii type 1 (at1) receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure. losartan (cozaar) is the prototype of a new class of potent and selective angiotensin ii (aii) type 1 (at(1)) receptor antagonists with the largest published preclinical and clinical data base. since all of the aii antagonists are selective for the at(1) receptor, these drugs should exhibit similar cardiovascular effects. however, since the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents and their degree of affinity for the at(1) receptor differ, it is likely that differences in clinical profiles between these drugs exist and will require investigation. losartan (parent compound), has moderate affinity for the at(1) receptor (competitive inhibition). losartan is well-absorbed orally as an active drug and is rapidly converted via oxidation in the human liver to a more potent metabolite (designated e3174) with an affinity 20- to 30-times greater for the at(1) receptor (non-competitive inhibition). e3174 has a half-life of 6 - 9 h; elimination is via renal and hepatic routes. antihypertensive and, in heart failure patients, haemodynamic activity is observed over a 24 h period with once daily dosing. over 6 million patients have been treated for hypertension with continued excellent tolerability. clinical experience in heart failure is growing, and recent data suggest an improved survival with losartan versus captopril, a drug from the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor class with proven benefit in this population. the current comprehensive losartan clinical end-point programme (4 large scale morbidity/mortality trials) should provide evidence regarding the efficacy of direct blockade of the at(1) receptor with losartan compared to standard therapy: 1) the losartan heart failure survival study - elite ii, 2) the losartan post-myocardial infarction survival study - optimaal, 3) the losartan hypertension survival study - life and 4) the losartan renal protection study - renaal.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ effect of amrinone on tumor necrosis factor production in endotoxic shock. tumor necrosis factor (tnf) is a macrophage-derived mediator responsible for many of the pathophysiologic manifestations of endotoxic shock. we now demonstrate that amrinone, a noncatechol inotrope, strongly inhibits lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced tnf production at concentrations readily achieved in vivo. this inhibition is apparent in murine macrophages, in macrophage cell lines, in vivo, and in cell lines containing a reporter gene construct that substitutes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) coding sequence for the tnf coding sequence and introns. inhibition by amrinone (like inhibition by pentoxifylline) is manifested at the level of mrna accumulation, in contrast to inhibition caused by dexamethasone. combined application of dexamethasone and amrinone caused additive inhibition of tnf biosynthesis in vitro. furthermore, treatment of mice with amrinone immediately prior to endotoxin challenge led to significantly improved survival. these findings suggest that amrinone possesses antiinflammatory as well as inotropic properties that may make it an appropriate agent for use in septic shock or other serious bacterial infections. abrupt removal of amrinone or pentoxifylline from the culture medium prior to lps stimulation, however, caused significantly augmented tnf production. therefore, amrinone and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also enhance sensitivity to lps during a period of time following discontinuation of therapy.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ functional characteristics of h+ -dependent nicotinate transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. in the present study, we report the characteristics of h(+)-coupled nicotinate transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. the [(3)h]nicotinate transport in rat astrocytes increased up to a ph 5.5. the nicotinic acid uptake at ph 6.0 was both energy-dependent and saturable with a michaelis constant (k(t)) of 2.8+/-0.4 mm and the maximal uptake rate (v(max)) of 31+/-3.2 nmol/mg protein/10 min. this process was reduced by a protonophore, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and a typical monocarboxylate transporter (mct) inhibitor, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, suggesting that nicotinate uptake by rat astrocytes is mediated by h(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transport system. [(3)h]nicotinate transport in rat astrocytes was significantly inhibited by various monocarboxylic acids such as l-lactic acid and pyruvic acid with a relatively low affinity (k(i)>10 mm). on the other hand, the uptake process of l-lactic acid was also saturable with a high-affinity component (k(t)=0.27 mm) and a low-affinity component (k(t)=35.9 mm). reverse transcription-pcr and western blot analyses revealed that three mct subtypes, mct1/slc16a1, mct2/slc16a7, and mct4/slc16a3, were expressed in these cells. because l-lactate reduced to 67% of the nicotinate uptake even at 10mm, it is unlikely that nicotinate uptake in rat astrocytes is mediated by mct1 and/or mct2. these results provide biochemical evidence of a h(+)-coupled and saturable transport system, presumed to be a low-affinity monocarboxylate transporter mct4 or other unknown h(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transport system, for nicotinate in rat cerebrocortical astrocytes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ nicotinic-receptor potentiator drugs, huprine x and galantamine, increase ach release by blocking ache activity but not acting on nicotinic receptors. the main goal of the present study was to analyse the effects of (+/-)-huprine x ((+/-)-hx) and galantamine (gal), with potentiating action on nicotinic receptors, and huperzine a (hpa), devoid of nicotinic activity, on [3h]-acetylcholine ([3h]-ach) release in striatal slices of rat brain. all compounds are non-covalent and reversible inhibitors of ache. addition of (+/-)-hx (0.01 microm), gal (10 microm) and hpa (0.1 microm) to the superfusion medium decreased the release of the ach neurotransmitter to a similar extent: 36%, 30% and 34%, respectively (p<0.01). this effect was reverted in the presence of atropine (atr; 0.1 microm), which blocks the pre-synaptic muscarinic m2 receptor. after that, a wide range of concentrations of drugs, concomitantly with atr (0.1 microm), was studied in the presence of haloperidol (hal; 0.01 microm), a dopamine d2 antagonist. in these conditions, a dose-dependent increase of [3h]-ach release was observed in the presence of (+/-)-hx, gal and hpa. to test the role of nicotinic receptors in the drugs' effects on [3h]-ach release, mecamylamine (mec) 100 microm was used to block such receptors. mec alone significantly decreased neurotransmitter release by 18% (p<0.05), but no change was obtained in the presence of both atr and mec. under these conditions, (+/-)-hx, gal and hpa increased the release of [3h]-ach by 37%, 25% and 38%, respectively (p<0.01). taking into account all of these data, the present results suggest that the effects induced by (+/-)-hx and gal nicotinic-receptor potentiators seem to be mainly due to their ability in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity, but not by interaction on the nicotinic receptors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ rat hepatic stellate cells become retinoid unresponsive during activation. hepatic stellate cells (hsc) play an essential role in fibrogenesis. many stimuli cause hsc to activate, lose their vitamin a and produce collagen. it is unclear whether vitamin a loss causes activation, potentiates it or is simply an event in the cascade of activation changes. we determine if exogenous retinoids prevent the activation of freshly isolated rat hsc activated by plating on plastic. we also determine if retinoids: (1) reverse hsc activation; (2) maintain/restore hsc intracellular retinoid levels; (3) maintain expression of hsc nuclear receptors for retinoic acid (rar) in hsc that are becoming activated or are chronically activated. markers of activation in freshly isolated hsc were decreased by either retinol or retinoic acid without increases in hsc retinoid concentration. mrna levels for rar-alpha, rar-beta and rar-gamma, the nuclear receptors for retinoic acid, decreased during activation of freshly isolated hsc even with retinoid supplementation. rar-alpha, rar-beta and rar-gamma mrna and rar-beta protein was undetectable in chronically activated hsc and remained absent after retinoic acid supplementation. activation markers in chronically activated hsc were only slightly decreased after retinoid exposure. we conclude that exposure of hsc to extracellular retinoids diminishes some markers of activation but does not prevent hsc activation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ overview of monoclonal antibodies and small molecules targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in colorectal cancer. the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) provides survival signals and is overexpressed in the majority of colorectal cancers. as more is learned about the molecular details of egfr signaling, antibodies can be designed to interfere with specific domains of the egfr molecule. in this review, we analyze preclinical and current clinical data on egfr-targeting molecules and their potential role in the treatment of colorectal cancer. cetuximab binds to domain iii of egfr and hinders ligand binding. it is now approved by the us food and drug administration for metastatic colorectal cancer treatment. panitumumab is another widely studied anti-egfr antibody with similar properties. bispecific antibodies are modified immunoglobulin molecules containing 2 different binding specificities. these antibodies can redirect the immune response against tumor cells by tethering effector cells such as cd3e-expressing t cells or cd16-expressing natural killer cells and granulocytes to the surface of cancer cells. tyrosine kinase inhibitors are quinazoline-derived, low molecular weight synthetic molecules that can block the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of several receptors, including egfr, erb2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and thereby inhibit ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and abrogate the biologic effect of egfr signaling. the presence of skin rash and egfr gene amplification have been advanced as possible predictors of clinical effectiveness of targeted anti-egfr therapies.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ isolation and function of the amino acid transporter pat1 (slc36a1) from rabbit and discrimination between transport via pat1 and system imino in renal brush-border membrane vesicles. reabsorption of amino acids is an important function of the renal proximal tubule. ph-dependent amino acid transport has been measured previously using rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles (bbmv). the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether this ph-dependent uptake represents h(+)/amino acid cotransport via a pat1-like transport system. the rabbit pat1 cdna was isolated (2296bp including both 5' and 3' untranslated regions and poly(a) tail) and the open reading frame codes for a protein of 475 amino acids (92% identity to human pat1). rabbit pat1 mrna was found in all tissues investigated including kidney. when expressed heterologously in a mammalian cell line, rabbit pat1 mediates ph-dependent, na(+)-independent uptake of proline, glycine, l-alanine and alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid. proline uptake was maximal at ph 5.0 (k(m) 2.2+/-0.7 mm). a transport system with identical characteristics (ion dependency, substrate specificity) was detected in rabbit renal bbmv where an overshoot was observed in the absence of na+ but in the presence of an inwardly directed h+ gradient. in the presence of na+ and under conditions in which pat1 transport function was suppressed, a second proline uptake system was detected that exhibited functional characteristics similar to those of the imino system. the functional characteristics of rabbit pat1 in either mammalian cells or renal bbmv suggest that pat1 is the low-affinity transporter of proline, glycine and hydroxyproline believed to be defective in patients with iminoglycinuria.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ antidepressants suppress production of the th1 cytokine interferon-gamma, independent of monoamine transporter blockade. in this study, antidepressants with selectivity for the noradrenaline transporter (reboxetine and desipramine), or the serotonin transporter (fluoxetine and clomipramine) were examined in terms of their ability to promote an anti-inflammatory cytokine phenotype in human blood. in addition, we examined the ability of trimipramine; a tricyclic antidepressant that is devoid of monoamine reuptake inhibitory properties on cytokine production. lipopolysaccharide (lps) was used to stimulate monocyte-derived pro-inflammatory (il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-12) and anti-inflammatory (il-10) cytokines, whilst concanavalin a (con a) was used to stimulate t-cell (th(1): ifn-gamma and th(2/3): il-10) cytokines. all of the antidepressants suppressed ifn-gamma production in the 10-50 microm concentration range, irrespective of their preference for serotonin or noradrenaline transporters. this suppression of ifn-gamma production was paralleled by reduced t-cell proliferation, therefore we suggest that the ability of antidepressants to suppress ifn-gamma production may be related to their anti-proliferative properties. the fact that trimipramine also suppressed ifn-gamma production and t-cell proliferation indicates that these immunomodulatory actions of antidepressants are most likely unrelated to inhibition of monoamine reuptake. interestingly, exposure to a lower concentration (1 microm) of the antidepressants tended to increase t-cell-derived il-10 production, with significant effects elicited by the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors reboxetine and desipramine. in contrast to the robust actions of antidepressants on t-cell derived cytokine production, they failed to induce any consistent change in lps-induced monocyte cytokine production. overall, our results indicate that ifn-gamma producing t-cells (th(1) cells) are the major target for the immunomodulatory actions of antidepressants, and provide evidence questioning the relationship between the monoaminergic reuptake properties of antidepressants and their immunomodulatory effects. the potential clinical significance of the anti-inflammatory actions of antidepressants is discussed.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ effect of cyproheptadine on serum leptin levels. leptin is a 167 amino acid protein encoded by the obesity gene that is synthesized in adipose tissue and interacts with receptors in the hypothalamus linked to the regulation of appetite and metabolism. it is known to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. cyproheptadine is a piperidine antihistamine that increases appetite through its antiserotonergic effect on 5-ht2 receptors in the brain. although both leptin and cyproheptadine are effective in controlling appetite, their interaction has not been addressed in clinical studies. this study evaluated serum leptin concentrations in patients who received cyproheptadine to treat a variety of disorders. sixteen patients aged 7 to 71 years (mean, 26.25 years) were given cyproheptadine 2 to 6 mg/day for a minimum of 7 days. body weight was measured and blood samples were obtained at baseline and after 1 week of treatment. serum leptin levels were determined by leptin radioimmunoassay. the mean body weight at baseline (52.59 kg) did not differ significantly from that at 1 week after treatment (52.84 kg; p > .05), but the mean leptin level after 1 week of treatment with cyproheptadine (3.14 ng/ml) was 14.2% higher than that at baseline (2.75 ng/ml; p < .05). this increase may suggest that both leptin and cyproheptadine may affect appetite via similar receptors and that cyproheptadine does not impair leptin activity through these receptors. further study will be necessary to clarify this relationship.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ intrauterine pressure, ischemia markers, and experienced pain during administration of a vasopressin v1a receptor antagonist in spontaneous and vasopressin-induced dysmenorrhea. background: a model to study the effect of vasopressin v1a antagonist in dysmenorrhea. methods: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial was performed. eight patients with primary dysmenorrhea and eight tuballigated, healthy subjects participated on days 1-2 of two consecutive menstruations. at each menstruation a bolus injection of 10 pmol/kg of vasopressin was administered before and during infusion of either 300 microg/min of atosiban or placebo. intrauterine pressure was measured as area under the curve throughout the experiments. ischemia markers in plasma and pain recorded by a visual analog scale were measured before and after each vasopressin injection as well as before and after the start of either atosiban or placebo infusion. results: vasopressin injections elevated area under the curve in both healthy volunteers and dysmenorrhea subjects. the vasopressin-induced rise in area under the curve was lower during atosiban administration than during infusion of placebo in both groups. none of the ischemia markers differed between or within groups at vasopressin injections or atosiban/placebo infusions. in subjects with dysmenorrhea the increase in pain following the administration of vasopressin was significantly lower during atosiban than during placebo infusion. healthy volunteers experienced only slight discomfort after the vasopressin injections. conclusions: atosiban reduces vasopressin-induced intrauterine pressure in both healthy volunteers and dysmenorrheics, and reported pain in subjects with dysmenorrhea. the ischemia markers are not a useful biomarker index in women with dysmenorrhea. the dysmenorrhea pain evoked by vasopressin correlated poorly with area under the curve, which may suggest that the effect is mediated by more than one v1a-like receptor. we conclude that this model with recordings in healthy women is useful in the evaluation of drug candidates for primary dysmenorrhea.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ lipid specific activation of the murine p4-atpase atp8a1 (atpase ii). the asymmetric transbilayer distribution of phosphatidylserine (ps) in the mammalian plasma membrane and secretory vesicles is maintained, in part, by an atp-dependent transporter. this aminophospholipid "flippase" selectively transports ps to the cytosolic leaflet of the bilayer and is sensitive to vanadate, ca(2+), and modification by sulfhydryl reagents. although the flippase has not been positively identified, a subfamily of p-type atpases has been proposed to function as transporters of amphipaths, including ps and other phospholipids. a candidate ps flippase atp8a1 (atpase ii), originally isolated from bovine secretory vesicles, is a member of this subfamily based on sequence homology to the founding member of the subfamily, the yeast protein drs2, which has been linked to ribosomal assembly, the formation of golgi-coated vesicles, and the maintenance of ps asymmetry. to determine if atp8a1 has biochemical characteristics consistent with a ps flippase, a murine homologue of this enzyme was expressed in insect cells and purified. the purified atp8a1 is inactive in detergent micelles or in micelles containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylinositol, is minimally activated by phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylethanolamine (pe), and is maximally activated by ps. the selectivity for ps is dependent upon multiple elements of the lipid structure. similar to the plasma membrane ps transporter, atp8a1 is activated only by the naturally occurring sn-1,2-glycerol isomer of ps and not the sn-2,3-glycerol stereoisomer. both flippase and atp8a1 activities are insensitive to the stereochemistry of the serine headgroup. most modifications of the ps headgroup structure decrease recognition by the plasma membrane ps flippase. activation of atp8a1 is also reduced by these modifications; phosphatidylserine-o-methyl ester, lysophosphatidylserine, glycerophosphoserine, and phosphoserine, which are not transported by the plasma membrane flippase, do not activate atp8a1. weakly translocated lipids (pe, phosphatidylhydroxypropionate, and phosphatidylhomoserine) are also weak atp8a1 activators. however, n-methyl-phosphatidylserine, which is transported by the plasma membrane flippase at a rate equivalent to ps, is incapable of activating atp8a1 activity. these results indicate that the atpase activity of the secretory granule atp8a1 is activated by phospholipids binding to a specific site whose properties (ps selectivity, dependence upon glycerol but not serine, stereochemistry, and vanadate sensitivity) are similar to, but distinct from, the properties of the substrate binding site of the plasma membrane flippase.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ nmda receptors are not alone: dynamic regulation of nmda receptor structure and function by neuregulins and transient cholesterol-rich membrane domains leads to disease-specific nuances of glutamate-signalling. glutamate receptors of the n-methyl-d-asparate (nmda-) subtype are tetrameric allosteric and ligand-gated calcium channels. they are modulated by a variety of endogenous ligands and ions and play a pivotal role in memory-related signal transduction due to a voltage-dependent block by magnesium, which makes them hebbian coincidence detectors. on the structural level nmda receptors have an enormous flexibility due to seven genes (nr1, nr2a-d and nr3a-b), alternative splicing, rna-editing and extensive posttranslational modifications, like phosphorylation and glycosylation. nmda receptors are thought to be responsible for excitotoxicity and subsequent downstream events like neuroinflammation and apoptosis and thus have been implicated in many important human pathologies, ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, alzheimer's and parkinson' disease, depression, epilepsy, trauma and stroke to schizophrenia. this fundamental significance of nmda receptor-related excitotoxicity is discussed in the context of the developing clinical success of memantine, but moreover set into relation to various proteomic and genetic markers of said diseases. the very complex localisational and functional regulation of nmda receptors appears to be dependent on neuregulins and receptor tyrosine kinases in cholesterol-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts), calcium-related mitochondrial feedback-loops and subsynaptic structural elements like psd-95 (post-synaptic density protein of 95 kd). the flexibility and multitude of interaction partners and possibilities of these highly dynamic molecular systems are discussed in terms of drug development strategies, in particular comparing high affinity and sub-type specific ligands to currently successful or promising therapies.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ hydrogen sulfide inhibits nitric oxide production and nuclear factor-kappab via heme oxygenase-1 expression in raw264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s), a regulatory gaseous molecule that is endogenously synthesized by cystathionine gamma-lyase (cse) and/or cystathionine beta-synthase (cbs) from l-cysteine (l-cys) metabolism, is a putative vasodilator, and its role in nitric oxide (no) production is unexplored. here, we show that at noncytotoxic concentrations, h(2)s was able to inhibit no production and inducible no synthase (inos) expression via heme oxygenase (ho-1) expression in raw264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps). both h(2)s solution prepared by bubbling pure h(2)s gas and nash, a h(2)s donor, dose dependently induced ho-1 expression through the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk). pretreatment with h(2)s or nahs significantly inhibited lps-induced inos expression and no production. moreover, no production in lps-stimulated macrophages that are expressing cse mrna was significantly reduced by the addition of l-cys, a substrate for h(2)s, but enhanced by the selective cse inhibitor beta-cyano-l-alanine but not by the cbs inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid. while either blockage of ho activity by the ho inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin ix, or down-regulation of ho-1 expression by ho-1 small interfering rna (sirna) reversed the inhibitory effects of h(2)s on inos expression and no production, ho-1 overexpression produced the same inhibitory effects of h(2)s. in addition, lps-induced nuclear factor (nf)-kappab activation was diminished in raw264.7 macrophages preincubated with h(2)s. interestingly, the inhibitory effect of h(2)s on nf-kappab activation was reversed by the transient transfection with ho-1 sirna, but was mimicked by either ho-1 gene transfection or treatment with carbon monoxide (co), an end product of ho-1. co treatment also inhibited lps-induced no production and inos expression via its inactivation of nf-kappab. collectively, our results suggest that h(2)s can inhibit no production and nf-kappab activation in lps-stimulated macrophages through a mechanism that involves the action of ho-1/co.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ effect of chronic renal failure on arginase and argininosuccinate synthetase expression. background: l-arginine (l-arg) participates in numerous biological functions including urea and nitric oxide synthesis. sources of l-arg include dietary proteins and endogenous synthesis by argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase. l-arg is converted to urea by arginase i in the liver and arginase ii in the kidney. normally, the liver fully consumes l-arg for urea generation and does not contribute to its circulating pool. instead, much of the circulating l-arg is produced by the kidney. if true, plasma l-arg should be severely reduced in chronic renal failure (crf); however, plasma l-arg is frequently unchanged in crf. we hypothesized that preservation of plasma l-arg in crf may be, partly, due to downregulation/inhibition of arginase. methods: argininosuccinate synthetase, arginase i and ii protein abundance and activity were measured in the liver and kidneys of rats 6 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy or sham operation. in addition, arginase activity was measured in the presence of different urea concentrations to simulate azotemia in vitro. results: arginases i and ii protein abundance as well as arginase activity in the liver, measured in the physiological buffer, were similar among the crf and control groups. however, in vitro experiments simulating a uremic milieu revealed a marked concentration-dependent inhibition of arginase activity by urea in the tissue lysates. crf had no significant effect on argininosuccinate synthetase abundance in the kidney, liver, spleen or intestine. conclusions: although crf does not change the abundance or intrinsic properties of arginase, the inherent rise in urea concentration inhibits its enzymatic activity. the latter, in turn, attenuates l-arg catabolism and urea production and, thereby, mitigates the fall in plasma l-arg.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ abca12 is the major harlequin ichthyosis gene. harlequin ichthyosis (hi) is the most severe form of autosomal-recessive, congenital ichthyosis. affected infants have markedly impaired barrier function and are more susceptible to infection. abnormalities in the localization of epidermal lipids as well as abnormal lamellar granule formation are features of hi skin. previously, we and others have shown that mutations in the abca12 gene encoding an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (abc) transporter underlie the skin disease hi. in this study, we have sequenced the abca12 gene in an additional 14 patients and show that all contain mutations, with the majority being either nonsense substitution or frameshift mutations. eleven hi patients had bi-allelic abca12 mutations, whereas in the remaining three hi patients in this study, abca12 mutations were detected on only one allele by sequencing. in addition, the one patient from the previous study where no sequence mutations were detected was screened for heterozygous deletions. a combination of oligonucleotide arrays, multiplex pcr analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping revealed a heterozygous intragenic deletion in exon 8. these mutation data establish abca12 as the major hi gene.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ phosphorylation and up-regulation of diacylglycerol kinase gamma via its interaction with protein kinase c gamma. diacylglycerol (dag) acts as an allosteric activator of protein kinase c (pkc) and is converted to phosphatidic acid by dag kinase (dgk). therefore, dgk is thought to be a negative regulator of pkc activation. here we show molecular mechanisms of functional coupling of the two kinases. gammapkc directly associated with dgkgamma through its accessory domain (ad), depending on ca2+ as well as phosphatidylserine/diolein in vitro. mass spectrometric analysis and mutation studies revealed that gammapkc phosphorylated ser-776 and ser-779 in the ad of dgkgamma. the phosphorylation by gammapkc resulted in activation of dgkgamma because a dgkgamma mutant in which ser-776 and ser-779 were substituted with glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation exhibited significantly higher activity compared with wild type dgkgamma and an unphosphorylatable dgkgamma mutant. importantly, the interaction of the two kinases and the phosphorylation of dgkgamma by gammapkc could be confirmed in vivo, and overexpression of the ad of dgkgamma inhibited re-translocation of gammapkc. these results demonstrate that localization and activation of the functionally correlated kinases, gammapkc and dgkgamma, are spatio-temporally orchestrated by their direct association and phosphorylation, contributing to subtype-specific regulation of dgkgamma and dag signaling.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ differences in conformational stability between native and phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase as evidenced by a monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibody 25b1 generated against diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate inhibited fetal bovine serum acetylcholinesterase has been extensively characterized with respect to its anticholinesterase properties. this antibody demonstrated considerably different properties from previously reported inhibitory antibodies raised against acetylcholinesterase in terms of the degree of inhibition (greater than 98%), the high degree of specificity, and the stability of the antigen-antibody complex. monoclonal antibody 25b1 appears to be directed against a conformational epitope located in close proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme and was found to be most suitable for studying the stabilization of the active site of acetylcholinesterase against denaturation by heat or guanidine following phosphorylation by organophosphorus anticholinesterase compounds. this approach allowed the determination of stability rank order of various phosphorylated acetylcholinesterases. among all the organophosphates tested, the combination of a methyl group and a negatively charged oxygen attached to the p atom, ch3p(o)(o-)-ache, conferred the greatest protection to the active site of aged or nonaged organophosphoryl conjugates of acetylcholinesterase.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ effects of folic acid deficiency and mthfr c677t polymorphism on spontaneous and radiation-induced micronuclei in human lymphocytes. folic acid plays a key role in the maintenance of genomic stability, providing methyl groups for the conversion of uracil to thymine and for dna methylation. besides dietary habits, folic acid metabolism is influenced by genetic polymorphism. the c677t polymorphism of the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) gene is associated with a reduction of catalytic activity and is suggested to modify cancer risk differently depending on folate status. in this work the effect of folic acid deficiency on genome stability and radiosensitivity has been investigated in cultured lymphocytes of 12 subjects with different mthfr genotype (four for each genotype). cells were grown for 9 days with 12, 24 and 120 nm folic acid and analyzed in a comprehensive micronucleus test coupled with centromere characterization by crest immunostaining. in other experiments, cells were grown with various folic acid concentrations, irradiated with 0.5 gy of gamma rays and analyzed in the micronucleus test. the results obtained indicate that folic acid deficiency induces to a comparable extent chromosome loss and breakage, irrespective of the mthfr genotype. the effect of folic acid was highly significant (p < 0.001) and explained >50% of variance of both types of micronuclei. also nucleoplasmic bridges and buds were significantly increased under low folate supply; the increase in bridges was mainly observed in tt cells, highlighting a significant effect of the mthfr genotype (p = 0.006) on this biomarker. folic acid concentration significantly affected radiation-induced micronuclei (p < 0.001): the increased incidence of radiation-induced micronuclei with low folic acid was mainly accounted for by carriers of the variant mthfr allele (both homozygotes and heterozygotes), but the overall effect of genotype did not attain statistical significance. treatment with ionizing radiations also increased the frequency of nucleoplasmic bridges. the effect of folic acid level on this end-point was modulated by the mthfr genotype (p for interaction = 0.02), with tt cells grown at low folic acid concentration apparently resistant to the induction of radiation-induced bridges. finally, the effect of in vitro folate deprivation on global dna methylation was evaluated in lymphocytes of six homozygous subjects (three cc and three tt). the results obtained suggest that, under the conditions of this work, folic acid deprivation is associated with global dna hypermethylation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ antifungal agents: mode of action in yeast cells. different kinds of mycoses, especially invasive, have become an important public health problem as their incidence has increased dramatically in the last decades in relation to aids, hematological malignancies, transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed individuals. management of fungal infections is markedly limited by problems of drug safety, resistance and effectiveness profile. current therapy for invasive mycoses uses a relatively reduced number of antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin b, fluconazole and itraconazole. other new antifungal agents from old and new chemical families, like voriconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, caspofungin and micafungin, have been introduced into the armamentarium for fungal infections management. this review is focused on the mode of action of those antifungal drugs used against pathogenic yeasts. the interaction of amphotericin b with ergosterol and other membrane sterols results in the production of aqueous pores of drug and the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is the target of the allylamines, phenylmorpholines and azole antifungal agents. the main molecular target of azole antifungals is the cytochrome p-450 protein erg11p/cyp51p. echinocandins, a new class of antifungal drugs, are fungal secondary metabolites that act against beta-1-3-d-glucan synthesis. the phenylmorpholines, of which amorolfine is the sole representative in human therapy, affect two targets in the ergosterol pathway: erg24p (delta 14 reductase) and erg2p (delta 8-delta 7 isomerase). the sordarins group are protein synthesis inhibitors that work by blocking the function of fungal translation elongation factor 2. other protein inhibitors are zofimarin, be31045, sch57504, xylarin, hypoxysordarin and gr135402. in order to overcome the problems derived from the exploitation of azole drugs, macrolides and echinocandins, novel targets were explored. proposed antifungal drugs have been developed against potential targets like the n-myristylation of fungal proteins, with inhibitors like myristate and histidine analogues or myristoylpeptide derivatives, aminobenzothiazoles, quinolines and benzofurans. polymerization of cell wall carbohydrates from uridine di-phospho sugars is another potential target.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate as a surrogate of d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-tris phosphate to monitor g protein-coupled receptor activation. phospholipase c beta (plc-beta)-coupled g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) activities traditionally are assessed by measuring ca2+ triggered by d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3), a plc-beta hydrolysis product, or by measuring the production of inositol phosphate using cumbersome radioactive assays. a specific detection of ip3 production was also established using ip3 binding proteins. the short lifetime of ip3 makes this detection very challenging in measuring gpcr responses. indeed, this ip3 rapidly enters the metabolic inositol phosphate cascade. it has been known for decades that lithium chloride (licl) leads to d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate accumulation on gpcr activation by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase, the final enzyme of the ip3 metabolic cascade. we show here that ip1 can be used as a surrogate of ip3 to monitor gpcr activation. we developed a novel homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (htrf) assay that correlates perfectly with existing methods and is easily amenable to high-throughput screening. the ip-one assay was validated on various gpcr models. it has the advantage over the traditional ca2+ assay of allowing the measurement of inverse agonist activity as well as the analysis of plc-beta activity in any nontransfected primary cultures. finally, the high assay specificity for d-myo-inositol 1 monophosphate (ip1(1)) opens new possibilities in developing selective assays to study the functional roles of the various isoforms of inositol phosphates.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ non-enzymatic interactions of glyoxylate with lysine, arginine, and glucosamine: a study of advanced non-enzymatic glycation like compounds. glyoxylate is a 2 carbon aldo acid that is formed in hepatic tissue from glycolate. once formed, the molecule can be converted to glycine by alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (agat). in defects of agat, glyoxylate is transformed to oxalate, resulting in high levels of oxalate in the body. the objective of this study was 2-fold. first, it was to determine, if akin to d-glucose, d-fructose or dl-glyceraldehyde, glyoxylate was susceptible to non-enzymatic attack by amino containing molecules such as lysine, arginine or glucosamine. second, if by virtue of its molecular structure and size, glyoxylate was as reactive a reagent in non-enzymatic reactions as dl-glyceraldehyde; i.e., a glycose that we previously demonstrated to be a more effective glycating agent than d-glucose or d-fructose. using capillary electrophoresis (ce), high performance liquid chromatography and uv and fluorescence spectroscopy, glyoxylate was found to be a highly reactive precursor of advanced glycation like end products (agles) and a more effective promoter of non-enzymatic end products than d-glucose, d-fructose or dl-glyceraldehyde.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cortisol metabolism in hypertension. corticosteroids are critically involved in blood pressure regulation. lack of adrenal steroids in addison's disease causes life-threatening hypotension, whereas glucocorticoid excess in cushing's syndrome invariably results in high blood pressure. at a pre-receptor level, glucocorticoid action is modulated by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11beta-hsds). 11beta-hsd1 activates cortisone to cortisol to facilitate glucocorticoid receptor (gr)-mediated action. by contrast, 11beta-hsd2 plays a pivotal role in aldosterone target tissues where it catalyses the opposite reaction (i.e. inactivation of cortisol to cortisone) to prevent activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (mr) by cortisol. mutations in the 11beta-hsd2 gene cause a rare form of inherited hypertension, the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (ame), in which cortisol activates the mr resulting in severe hypertension and hypokalemia. ingestion of competitive inhibitors of 11beta-hsd2 such as liquorice and carbenoxolone result in a similar but milder clinical phenotype. epidemiological data suggests that polymorphic variability in the hsd11b2 gene determines salt sensitivity in the general population, which is a key predisposing factor to adult onset hypertension in some patients. extrarenal sites of glucocorticoid action and metabolism that might impact on blood pressure include the vasculature and the central nervous system. intriguingly, increased exposure to glucocorticoids during fetal life promotes high blood pressure in adulthood suggesting an early programming effect. thus, metabolism and action in many peripheral tissues might contribute to the pathophysiology of human hypertension.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ppargamma controls cd1d expression by turning on retinoic acid synthesis in developing human dendritic cells. dendritic cells (dcs) expressing cd1d, a molecule responsible for lipid antigen presentation, are capable of enhancing natural killer t (inkt) cell proliferation. the signals controlling cd1 expression and lipid antigen presentation are poorly defined. we have shown previously that stimulation of the lipid-activated transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)gamma, indirectly regulates cd1d expression. here we demonstrate that ppargamma, turns on retinoic acid synthesis by inducing the expression of retinol and retinal metabolizing enzymes such as retinol dehydrogenase 10 and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 (raldh2). ppargamma-regulated expression of these enzymes leads to an increase in the intracellular generation of all-trans retinoic acid (atra) from retinol. atra regulates gene expression via the activation of the retinoic acid receptor (rar)alpha in human dcs, and raralpha acutely regulates cd1d expression. the retinoic acid-induced elevated expression of cd1d is coupled to enhanced inkt cell activation. furthermore, in vivo relevant lipids such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein can also elicit retinoid signaling leading to cd1d up-regulation. these data show that regulation of retinoid metabolism and signaling is part of the ppargamma-controlled transcriptional events in dcs. the uncovered mechanisms allow the dcs to respond to altered lipid homeostasis by changing cd1 gene expression.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ sulfonylureas and glinides exhibit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activity: a combined virtual screening and biological assay approach. most drugs currently employed in the treatment of type 2 diabetes either target the sulfonylurea receptor stimulating insulin release (sulfonylureas, glinides), or target the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppargamma) improving insulin resistance (thiazolidinediones). our work shows that sulfonylureas and glinides additionally bind to ppargamma and exhibit ppargamma agonistic activity. this activity was predicted in silico by virtual screening and confirmed in vitro in a binding assay, a transactivation assay, and by measuring the expression of ppargamma target genes. among the measured compounds, gliquidone and glipizide (two sulfonylureas), as well as nateglinide (a glinide), exhibit ppargamma agonistic activity at concentrations comparable with those reached under pharmacological treatment. the most active of these compounds, gliquidone, is shown to be as potent as pioglitazone at inducing ppargamma target gene expression. this dual mode of action of sulfonylureas and glinides may open new perspectives for the molecular pharmacology of antidiabetic drugs, because it provides evidence that drugs can be designed that target both the sulfonylurea receptor and ppargamma. targeting both receptors could increase pancreatic insulin secretion and improve insulin resistance. glinides, sulfonylureas, and other acidified sulfonamides may be promising leads in the development of new ppargamma agonists. in addition, we provide a unified concept of the ppargamma binding ability of seemingly disparate compound classes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ pge(1) stimulation of hek293 cells generates multiple contiguous domains with different [camp]: role of compartmentalized phosphodiesterases. there is a growing appreciation that the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp)-protein kinase a (pka) signaling pathway is organized to form transduction units that function to deliver specific messages. such organization results in the local activation of pka subsets through the generation of confined intracellular gradients of camp, but the mechanisms responsible for limiting the diffusion of camp largely remain to be clarified. in this study, by performing real-time imaging of camp, we show that prostaglandin 1 stimulation generates multiple contiguous, intracellular domains with different camp concentration in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. by using pharmacological and genetic manipulation of phosphodiesterases (pdes), we demonstrate that compartmentalized pde4b and pde4d are responsible for selectively modulating the concentration of camp in individual subcellular compartments. we propose a model whereby compartmentalized pdes, rather than representing an enzymatic barrier to camp diffusion, act as a sink to drain the second messenger from discrete locations, resulting in multiple and simultaneous domains with different camp concentrations irrespective of their distance from the site of camp synthesis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ dna topoisomerase iialpha (top2a) inhibitors up-regulate fatty acid synthase gene expression in sk-br3 breast cancer cells: in vitro evidence for a 'functional amplicon' involving fas, her-2/neu and top2a genes. fatty acid synthase (fas), the key metabolic multi-enzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, plays an active role in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the malignant phenotype in a subset of breast carcinomas. we recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between fas and the her-2/neu (erbb-2) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. because her-2/neu has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that fas gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a her-2/neu-related manner. we herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of fas gene in breast cancer cells. to evaluate this option, fas- and her-2/neu-overexpressing sk-br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a fas promoter-reporter construct (fas-luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. sk-br3 cells cultured in the presence of topoisomerase iialpha (top2a) inhibitors doxorubicin and etopoxide (vp-16) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in fas promoter activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. we failed to observe any significant activation of fas promoter following exposure to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, the alkylating drug cisplatin, or the microtubule interfering-agents paclitaxel and vincristine. moreover, the up-regulatory effects of top2a inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of fas gene expression were not significantly decreased when the fas promoter was damaged at the sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp)-binding site. considering that fas inhibition produces profound inhibition of dna replication and s-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between top2a and fas could exhibit a her-2/neu-related bi-directional nature. top2a protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, fas promoter activity and fas protein expression were significantly reduced. of note, when the expression levels of top2a protein were analyzed following exposure of sk-br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding fas inhibitor c75, a dose-dependent reduction in top2a expression was observed. although fas gene is not physically located in the her-2/neu-top2a amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between fas, her-2/neu and top2a genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in the increased insulin secretion in rats with acute liver failure. to investigate the mechanism of hyperinsulinaemia in rats with acute liver failure induced by the administration of d-galactosamine (galn), we focused on the role of polyprimidine tract-binding protein (ptb) in islet insulin synthesis. recent reports indicate that ptb binds and stabilizes mrna encoding insulin and insulin secretory granule proteins, including islet cell autoantigen 512 (ica512), prohormone convertase 1/3 (pc1/3), and pc2. in the present study, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was significantly increased in galn-treated rats compared to controls. levels of mrna encoding insulin 1, ica512, and pc1/3 were increased in the pancreatic islets of galn-treated rats. this mrna level elevation was not prevented by pretreatment with actinomycin d. when the ptb-binding site in insulin 1 mrna was incubated with the islet cytosolic fraction, the rna-protein complex level was increased in the cytosolic fraction obtained from galn-treated rats compared to the level in control rats. the cytosolic fraction obtained from pancreatic islets obtained from galn-treated rats had an increased ptb level compared to the levels obtained from the pancreatic islets of control rats. these findings suggest that, in rats with acute liver failure, cytosolic ptb binds and stabilizes mrna encoding insulin and its secretory granule proteins.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ bcl-2 phosphorylation has pathological significance in human breast cancer. the anti-apoptotic molecule, bcl-2, is well known to play an important role in the chemoresistance of breast cancer. we have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of fas-associated death domain-containing protein (fadd) at 194 serine through c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk) activation sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy through accelerating cell cycle arrest at g2/m, and that bcl-2 phosphorylation downstream of jnk/fadd plays an important role in cell growth suppression by paclitaxel. in this study, the clinicopathological association of phosphorylated bcl-2 (p-bcl-2) with estrogen, progesterone, c-erbb-2 receptors, p53 expressions and phosphorylated fadd/jnk (p-fadd/jnk) was analyzed immunohistochemically using 107 human breast cancer specimens. expression of p-bcl-2 was found to significantly correlate with lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, but not histological differentiation, tumor grade or vascular and fatty invasion. the positivity of p-bcl-2 was also significantly correlated to that of p-fadd/jnk. thus, p-bcl-2 as well as the p-fadd/jnk parameter might be useful markers for cancer progression, independent of the hormone receptor status, in human breast cancers.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ studies on the mechanism of arterial vasodilation produced by the novel antihypertensive agent, carvedilol. the mechanism(s) responsible for arterial vasodilation observed following acute administration of racemic carvedilol, a novel vasodilator/beta adrenoceptor antagonist, has been investigated in rats. in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, carvedilol (0.03-3.0 mg/kg, iv) produced a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure with no significant effect on heart rate. because cardiac output was relatively unaffected, the antihypertensive response of carvedilol was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance. submaximal antihypertensive doses of carvedilol were chosen for mechanism of action studies in pithed rats. carvedilol (0.3 mg/kg, iv) produced a significant inhibition of the beta 1 adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic response to isoproterenol. this same dose of carvedilol also inhibited, but to a lesser degree, the beta 2 adrenoceptor mediated vasodepressor response to salbutamol in pithed rats whose blood pressure was elevated by a constant intravenous infusion of angiotensin ii. thus, carvedilol blocks both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors at antihypertensive doses, with modest selectivity being observed for the beta 1 adrenoceptor subtype. carvedilol produced significant inhibition of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to cirazoline in the pithed rat, but had no effect on the alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to b-ht 933, suggesting that carvedilol is also an alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist at antihypertensive doses. carvedilol had no effect on the pressor response elicited by angiotensin ii, indicating a lack of nonspecific vasodilator activity. the vasopressor response to the calcium channel activator, bay-k-8644, which is mediated through the opening of voltage dependent calcium channels and the subsequent translocation of extracellular calcium, was significantly inhibited by carvedilol (1 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that carvedilol is also a calcium channel antagonist, consistent with our previous in vitro studies. in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol was nearly abolished by combined pretreatment of the rats with high doses of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1 mg/kg, iv), and the nonselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (3 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that the majority of the antihypertensive response produced by carvedilol may be accounted for by blockade of beta and alpha 1 adrenoceptors. we therefore conclude that carvedilol, at antihypertensive doses, is an antagonist of beta 1, beta 2, and alpha 1 adrenoceptors, and also of calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle.(abstract truncated at 400 words)$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ phospholipase cgamma1 negatively regulates growth hormone signalling by forming a ternary complex with jak2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1b. growth hormone binds to its membrane receptor (ghr), whereby it regulates many cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation and chemotaxis. however, although the activation of growth hormone-mediated signalling is well understood, the precise mechanism responsible for its regulation has not been elucidated. here, we demonstrate that phospholipase cgamma1 (plcgamma1) modulates the action of growth hormone-mediated signalling by interacting with tyrosine kinase jak2 (janus kinase 2) in a growth hormone-dependent manner. in the absence of plcgamma1 (plcgamma1(-/-)), growth hormone-induced jak2 and stat5 phosphorylation significantly increased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs). furthermore, the re-expression of plcgamma1 reduced growth hormone-induced jak2 activation. growth hormone-induced jak2 phosphorylation was enhanced by sirna-specific knockdown of plcgamma1. interestingly, plcgamma1 physically linked jak2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1b (ptp-1b) by binding to both using different domains, and this process was implicated in the modulation of cytokine signalling through jak2. in addition, in plcgamma1(-/-) mefs, growth hormone-dependent c-fos activation was upregulated and growth hormone-induced proliferation was potentiated. these results suggest that plcgamma1 has a key function in the regulation of growth hormone-mediated signalling by negatively regulating jak2 activation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ increased responsiveness of rat colonic splanchnic afferents to 5-ht after inflammation and recovery. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) activates colonic splanchnic afferents, a mechanism by which it has been implicated in generating symptoms in postinfectious and postinflammatory states in humans. here we compared mechanisms of colonic afferent activation by 5-ht and mechanical stimuli in normal and inflamed rat colon, and after recovery from inflammation. colonic inflammation was induced in rats by dextran sulphate sodium. single-fibre recordings of colonic lumbar splanchnic afferents revealed that 58% of endings responded to 5-ht (10(-4) m) in controls, 88% in acute inflammation (p<0.05) and 75% after 21 days recovery (p < 0.05 versus control). maximal responses to 5-ht were also larger, and the estimated ec50 was reduced from 3.2 x 10(-6) to 8 x 10(-7) m in acute inflammation and recovered to 2 x 10(-6) m after recovery. responsiveness to mechanical stimulation was unaffected. 5-ht3 receptor antagonism with alosetron reduced responses to 5-ht in controls but not during inflammation. responses to the mast cell degranulator 48/80 mimicked those to 5-ht in inflamed tissue but not in controls, and more 5-ht-containing mast cells were seen close to calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing fibres in inflamed serosa. we conclude that colonic serosal and mesenteric endings exhibit increased sensitivity to 5-ht in inflammation, with both an increase in proportion of responders and an increase in sensitivity, which is maintained after healing of inflammation. this is associated with alterations in the roles of 5-ht3 receptors and mast cells.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ differential expression of glycans in the hippocampus of rats trained on an inhibitory learning paradigm. the glycan chains of glycoconjugates play important roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. in the cns, previous studies on learning and memory suggest the importance of oligosaccharides attached to glycoconjugates in the modulation of synaptic connections. we studied the hippocampal glycan distribution of rats subject to an inhibitory avoidance task. the expression of glycans was examined by lectin-histochemistry using vicia villosa lectin (vvl) for terminal alpha/beta n-acetylgalactosamine (alpha/beta galnac); galanthus nivalus lectin (gnl) for terminal mannose alpha-1,3 (man alpha-1,3); peanut agglutinin (pna) for galactose beta-1,3n-acetylgalactosamine (gal beta-1,3 galnac); erythrina cristagalli lectin (ecl) for galactose beta-1,4 n-acetylglucosamine (gal beta-1,4 glcnac); sambucus nigra lectin (sna) for sialic acid alpha-2.6 galactose (sa alpha-2,6 gal); maackia amurensis lectin ii (mal ii) for sialic acid alpha-2,3 (sa alpha-2,3); wheat germ agglutinin (wga) for terminal n-acetylglucosamine with/ without sialic acid (glcnac wo sa); succynilated wga (swga) for terminal n-acetylglucosamine without sialic acid (terminal glcnac without sa); griffonia simplicifolia lectin ii (gsl ii) for terminal alpha/beta n-acetylglucosamine (alpha/beta glcnac terminal); and lotus tetragonolobus lectin (ltl) alpha-fucose. two groups of 10 animals were examined: non-trained (control) and trained rats. ecl, swga and gsl ii were negative for both groups in all the hippocampal subfields studied. for both groups, vvl was negative in ca4 and granular cells of the dentate gyrus (dg) and ltl was negative in the ca4 subfield. expression of alpha/beta galnac, alpha-fucose and glcnac in other hippocampal subflields was positive, with no differences between groups. however, expression of man alpha-1,3 was significantly higher in the ca1, ca2, ca3, and ca4 subfields in the trained group. on the other hand, expression of gal beta-1,3 galnac was significantly low in ca4 and dg in the trained group. in conclusion, the results here presented indicate that the exposure of rats to an associative behavioral paradigm related to declarative memory, involves some regulatory mechanism/s for the differential patterns of glycan expression.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ glutamate stimulates glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system to regulate surface expression of glur2. the glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (grip1) is a scaffolding protein in postsynaptic density (psd), tethering ampa receptors to other signaling proteins. here we report that glutamate stimulation caused a rapid reduction in protein levels of grip1, but not that of glutamate receptor (glur) 1, glur2 and protein interacting with c kinase 1 (pick1) in rat primary cortical neuron cultures. down-regulation of grip1 by glutamate was blocked by carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (mg132), a proteasome inhibitor and by expression of k48r-ubiquitin, a dominant negative form of ubiquitin. the grip1 reduction was inhibited by mk-801, an n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist, but not by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (cnqx), an ampa receptor antagonist. egta and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n',n'-tetra acetic acid tetrakis (bapta), two ca2+ chelators, but not nifedipine, an l-type ca2+ channel blocker, prevented grip1 degradation. furthermore, mg132 prevented glutamate-stimulated reduction in surface amount of glur2, and knockdown of grip1 by rnai against grip1 reduced surface glur2 in neurons. our results suggest that glutamate induces grip1 degradation by proteasome through an nmda receptor-ca2+ pathway and that grip1 degradation may play an important role in regulating glur2 surface expression.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ transgenic expression of the human vitamin d receptor (hvdr) in the duodenum of vdr-null mice attenuates the age-dependent decline in calcium absorption. 1,25(oh)(2)d(3) regulates calcium homeostasis through its actions in the intestine, bone, and kidney. these actions are mediated through the vdr. to determine if vdr's actions in the proximal small intestine can sufficiently restore calcium homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice expressing hvdr exclusively in the duodenum of mvdr-null mice by using the adenosine deaminase enhancer (hvdr+/mvdr-null). unlike wild-type mice, hvdr+/mvdr-null mice express hvdr and vdr target genes only in the proximal small intestine. despite having functional hvdr in the proximal small intestine, hvdr+/mvdr-null mice were hypocalcaemic when fed a normal rodent diet at weaning, like mvdr-null mice fed the same diet. the hypocalcemia in these mice is prevented if they are given the rescue diet before weaning. however, when 90-day-old rachitic mice were fed a rescue diet, serum calcium improved in hvdr+/mvdr-null mice, but not in mvdr-null mice. in conclusion, transgenic hvdr in the proximal small intestine of hvdr+/mvdr-null mice was transcriptionally active and regulated calcium absorption, but vdr actions elsewhere in the intestine are probably necessary to support adequate calcium homeostasis. in addition, hvdr+/mvdr-null mice responded better to the late rescue diet suggesting that expression of vdr in the proximal small intestine protected the calcium absorbing machinery from age-dependent decline.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the inhibitory effect of the leukotriene receptor antagonist on leukotriene d4-induced muc2/5ac gene expression and mucin secretion in human airway epithelial cells. objectives: mucin gene expression and mucin production are markedly increased in inflammatory airway disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and rhinosinusitis. cytokines, lipopolysaccharides and other inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin and leukotriene are related to the secretion and production of mucin. however, the relationship of leukotrienes with mucin genes expression is not clear. the aim of this study is to evaluate muc2/5ac gene expression and mucin secretion by the leukotriene receptor in human airway epithelial cells. methods: the effect of leukotriene d(4) and the leukotriene receptor antagonist, pranlukast hydrate (ono-1078) on the regulation of muc2/5ac gene expression and mucin secretion were observed in human airway nci-h292 epithelial cells. the mrna levels of muc2/5ac and the amount of mucin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and immunoassay. results: leukotriene d(4) upregulated muc2/5ac gene expression and mucin secretion in a dose dependent pattern. pranlukast hydrate (ono-1078, 100 microm) downregulated the leukotriene d(4)-induced muc2/5ac gene expression and mucin secretion. conclusion: these results suggest that the leukotriene receptor system is one of the mechanisms related to muc2/5ac gene expression and mucin secretion in the human airway epithelium.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ effect of isolated isoflavone supplementation on abca1-dependent cholesterol efflux potential in postmenopausal women. objective: isoflavones may display beneficial health effects in postmenopausal women. we studied in a clinical trial whether isolated isoflavone treatment in postmenopausal women could affect reverse cholesterol transport as evaluated by adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette a1- (abca1), dependent cholesterol efflux from macrophages. in addition, various serum lipid and lipoprotein parameters were investigated. furthermore, we separately assessed equol-producing and non-equol-producing women. design: postmenopausal women (n=56) were treated with either isoflavone or placebo tablets for 3 months in a crossover design, separated by a 2-month washout period. fifteen women were classified as equol producers, and 15 women were classified as non-equol producers. serum samples were collected before and after each treatment period. [h]-cholesterol-labeled j774 macrophage cells, with and without abca1 up-regulation, were incubated with the samples, and abca1-dependent cholesterol efflux and serum lipid and lipoprotein levels were assessed. results: serum promoted 3.1%+/-1.1% and 3.2%+/-1.1% cholesterol efflux from macrophages after isoflavone and placebo treatment, respectively. thus, isoflavone supplementation did not affect abca1-dependent cholesterol efflux to serum. however, as a novel finding, isoflavone treatment increased a subclass of high-density lipoprotein, the pre-beta high-density lipoprotein levels by 18% without affecting any other serum lipid concentrations. abca1-facilitated cholesterol efflux and lipid parameters did not differ between equol-producing and non-equol-producing women. conclusion: in postmenopausal women, isolated isoflavone treatment does not affect abca1-dependent cholesterol efflux potential from macrophages but increases circulating pre-beta high-density lipoprotein level, which could provide beneficial vascular effects.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the ability of sorafenib to inhibit oncogenic pdgfrbeta and flt3 mutants and overcome resistance to other small molecule inhibitors. background and objectives: activated tyrosine kinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute leukemia, and represent attractive targets for therapy. sorafenib (bay43-9006, nexavar) is a small molecule b-raf inhibitor that is used for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, and has been shown to have activity against receptor tyrosine kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr) families. we investigated the efficacy of sorafenib at inhibiting mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinases pdgfrbeta, kit, and flt3, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. design and methods: we tested the effect of sorafenib on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by etv6-pdgfrbeta, flt3 with an internal tandem duplication or d835y point mutation, and the kit(d816v) mutant. the direct effect of sorafenib on the activity of these kinases and their downstream signaling was tested using phospho-specific antibodies. results: we show that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of etv6-pdgfrbeta and flt3 mutants, including some of the mutants that confer resistance to pkc412 and other flt3 inhibitors. sorafenib induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines mv4-11 and molm-13, both expressing flt3 with an internal tandem duplication, whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. the imatinib-resistant kit(d816v) mutant, associated with systemic mastocytosis, was found to be resistant to sorafenib. interpretation and conclusions: these results warrant further clinical studies of sorafenib for the treatment of myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of pdgfrbeta and flt3.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ glucocorticoids stimulate enac upregulation in bovine mammary epithelium. mammary epithelia produce an isotonic, low-na(+) fluid that is rich in nutrients. mechanisms that account for the low electrolyte concentration have not been elucidated, although amiloride-sensitive ion transport has been reported in some situations. we hypothesized that corticosteroid exposure modulates epithelial na(+) channel (enac) expression and/or activity in bovine mammary epithelial cells. bme-uv cells were grown to confluent monolayers on permeable supports with a standard basolateral medium and apical medium of low-electrolyte, high-lactose composition that resembles the ionic composition of milk. ion transport was assessed in modified ussing flux chambers. exposure to glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, cortisol, or prednisolone), but not aldosterone, increased short-circuit current (i(sc)), a sensitive measure of net ion transport, whereas apical exposure to amiloride or benzamil reduced corticosteroid-induced i(sc) close to basal levels. quantitative rt-pcr indicated a glucocorticoid-induced increase in mrna for beta- and gamma-enac, whereas alpha-enac mrna expression was only mildly affected. exposure to mifepristone (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist), but not spironolactone (a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist), precluded both the corticosteroid-induced elevation in amiloride-sensitive i(sc) and the induced changes in beta- and gamma-enac mrna. we conclude that na(+) movement across mammary epithelia is modulated by corticosteroids via a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanism that regulates the expression of the beta- and gamma-subunits of enac. enac expression and activity could account for the low na(+) concentration that is typical of milk.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ salicylate-based anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the early lesion of diabetic retinopathy. it has been previously reported that aspirin inhibited the development of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic animals, raising the possibility that anti-inflammatory drugs may have beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy. to further explore this, we compared effects of oral consumption of three different salicylate-based drugs (aspirin, sodium salicylate, and sulfasalazine) on the development of early stages of diabetic retinopathy in rats. these three drugs differ in their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase but share an ability to inhibit nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab). diabetes of 9-10 months duration significantly increased the number of tunel (transferase-mediated dutp nick-end labeling)-positive capillary cells and acellular (degenerate) capillaries in the retinal vasculature, and all three salicylate-based drugs inhibited this cell death and formation of acellular capillaries without altering the severity of hyperglycemia. in short-term diabetes (2-4 months), all three salicylates inhibited the diabetes-induced loss of neuronal cells from the ganglion cell layer. oral aspirin (as a representative of the salicylate family) inhibited diabetes-induced increase in nf-kappab dna-binding affinity in electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transcription factor array in nuclear extract isolated from whole retina. all three salicylates inhibited the diabetes-induced translocation of p50 (a subunit of nf-kappab) into nuclei of retinal vascular endothelial cells of the isolated retinal vasculature, as well as of p50 and p65 into nuclei of cells in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer on whole-retinal sections. sulfasalazine (also as a representative of the salicylates) inhibited the diabetes-induced upregulation of several inflammatory gene products, which are regulated by nf-kappab, including vascular cell adhesion molecule, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 in whole-retinal lysate. salicylates, in doses administrated in our experiments, inhibited nf-kappab and perhaps other transcription factors in the retina, were well tolerated, and offered new tools to investigate and inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ localization of an 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity to the distal nephron. evidence for the existence of two species of dehydrogenase in the rat kidney. an 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta hsd) activity has been localized in the rat kidney by a histochemical technique which links steroid metabolism with the production of a color reaction. oxidation of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was observed in cortical distal convoluted tubules and in medullary collecting ducts. carbenoxolone abolished staining, no reaction was obtained with androstenedione hydroxylated at the 17 or 19 position, and oxidation of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (nad) dependent. these results demonstrate the presence of a dehydrogenase activity separate from the nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadp)-dependent 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase recently purified and cloned from rat liver. we have named this activity 11 beta hsd2 to distinguish it from the nadp-dependent 11 beta hsd. histological studies showed that 11 beta hsd2 activity does not correlate with the immunocytochemical localization of the previously defined 11 beta hsd enzyme, but rather the 11 beta hsd2 activity is localized in the distal tubules of the rat kidney. in this respect 11 beta hsd2 colocalizes with the mineralocorticoid receptor. no reaction product was obtained using cortisol or corticosterone as substrate with either nad or nadp as cofactor. furthermore incubation of tissue sections with 11 beta androstenedione in the presence of deoxycorticosterone completely inhibited cytochemical staining. we interpret these results as evidence of 20 reductase activity which uses the reduced cofactor at the expense of the color reaction. these results support the crucial role played by an 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the local protection of type i receptors in mineralocorticoid selective tissues.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ effect of long-term fluoxetine treatment on the human serotonin transporter in caco-2 cells. fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) broadly used in the treatment of human mood disorders and gastrointestinal diseases involving the serotoninergic system. the effectiveness of this therapy depends on repeated long-term treatment. most of the long-term studies in vivo of ssri effects on serotoninergic activity have focused on their effects on autoreceptors or postsynaptic receptors. the chronic effect of ssris on the activity of the serotonin transporter (sert) has been less studied and the results have been contradictory. the aim of this study was to determine the specific effect of long-term fluoxetine treatment on human serotonin transporter (hsert) in vitro, by using the human enterocyte-like cell line caco-2. results show that fluoxetine diminished the 5-ht uptake in a concentration-dependent way and that this effect was reversible. fluoxetine affected mainly the hsert transport rate by reducing the availability of the transporter in the membrane with no significant alteration of either the total hsert protein content or the hsert mrna level. these results suggest that the effect of fluoxetine on the expression of hsert is post-translational and has shown itself to be independent of pkc and pka activity. this study may be useful to clarify the effect of the long-term fluoxetine therapy in both gastrointestinal and central nervous system disorders.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ roles played by lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 in the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity. lymphocytes possess the essential components of a cholinergic system, including acetylcholine (ach); choline acetyltransferase (chat), its synthesizing enzyme; and both muscarinic and nicotinic ach receptors (machrs and nachrs, respectively). stimulation of lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin, which activates t cells via the t cell receptor/cd3 complex, enhances the synthesis and release of ach and up-regulates expression of chat and m(5) machr mrnas. in addition, activation of protein kinase c and increases in intracellular camp also enhance cholinergic activity in t cells, and lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (lfa-1; cd11a/cd18) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and t cell activation. anti-cd11a monoclonal antibody (mab) as well as antithymocyte globulin containing antibodies against cd2, cd7 and cd11a all increase chat activity, ach synthesis and release, and expression of chat and m(5) machr mrnas in t cells. the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits lfa-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on cd11a (lfa-1 alpha chain), which leads to immunomodulation. we found that simvastatin abolishes anti-cd11a mab-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. collectively then, these results indicate that lfa-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via cd11a-mediated pathways and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine1b receptors in rat spinal cord via [125i]iodocyanopindolol binding and inhibition of [3h]-5-hydroxytryptamine release. the aim of the present study in rat spinal cord synaptosomes was to compare the pharmacological characteristics of the serotonin (5-ht)1b receptor defined by [125i]iodocyanopindolol [( 125i] icyp) binding and the 5-ht autoreceptor defined by inhibition of [3h]-5-ht release. in percoll gradient fractions 3 and 4 of spinal cord synaptosomes, a single saturable binding site for [125i]icyp with a maximum binding of 70 and 134 fmol/mg, respectively, was demonstrated in the presence of 30 microm isoproterenol. the kd of 0.16 nm did not vary between fractions. competition for [125i]icyp binding by various 5-ht agonists and antagonists also indicated a single site model based on a hill coefficient of approximately 1.0. the most potent compounds at displacing [125i]icyp binding were ru 24969 (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl]-1h-indole), 5-carboxyamidotryptamine hcl, 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-ht and cgs 12066b (7-trifluoromethyl-4(4 methyl-1-pyrolo[1,2-a]-quinoxaline malate). [125i]icyp binding was not altered by compounds with activity at 5-ht1a, 5-ht1c, 5-ht2, 5-ht3 or alpha-2 receptor sites. similar to the pharmacological characteristics of the 5ht1b site defined by [125i]icyp, compounds most active at inhibiting 15 mm k(+)-stimulated release of [3h]-5-ht were ru24969 = 5-carboxyamidotryptamine hcl = cgs 12066b greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than 5-ht. compounds with activity at 5-ht1a, 5-ht1c, 5-ht2 or 5-ht3 sites were inactive. a correlation analysis of selective 5-ht1b compounds comparing the pkd for displacement of [125i]icyp vs. the ic50 for inhibition of [3h]-5-ht release demonstrated the pharmacological similarity of the presynaptic inhibitory 5-ht autoreceptor and the 5-ht receptor site defined by [125i]icyp binding in spinal cord synaptosomes (r = 0.791, p = .0193). although [125i]icyp binding was unaltered, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine, norepinephrine and uk 14304 [5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-ylamino]-quinoxaline) as well as the alpha-2 antagonists rauwolscine and yohimbine also decreased the k(+)-stimulated release of [3h]-5-ht and phentolamine, an alpha-2 antagonist increased release. the action of these alpha-2 compounds to alter [3h]-5-ht release suggests the presence of heteroreceptors localized on 5-ht terminals in the spinal cord. these results point out that [125i]icyp identifies the 5-ht1b receptor, and affinity of compounds for this site predicts action at the 5-ht1b autoreceptor.(abstract truncated at 400 words)$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ histamine h1 receptor involvement in prepulse inhibition and memory function: relevance for the antipsychotic actions of clozapine. histamine h(1) blockade is one of the more prominent actions of the multi-receptor acting antipsychotic clozapine. it is currently not known how much this h(1) antagonism of clozapine contributes to the therapeutic or adverse side effects of clozapine. the current studies with sprague-dawley rats were conducted to determine the participation of histaminergic h(1) receptor subtype in sensorimotor plasticity and memory function affected by clozapine using tests of prepulse inhibition (ppi) and radial-arm maze choice accuracy. the ppi impairment caused by the glutamate antagonist dizocilpine (mk-801) was significantly attenuated by clozapine. in the current project, we found that the selective h(1) antagonist pyrilamine also reversed the dizocilpine-induced impairment in ppi of tactile startle with an auditory prepulse. in the radial-arm maze (ram), pyrilamine, like clozapine, impaired working memory and caused a significant dose-related slowing of response. pyrilamine, however, decreased the number of reference memory errors. we have previously shown that nicotine effectively attenuates the clozapine-induced working memory impairment, but in the current study, nicotine did not significantly alter the effects of pyrilamine on the ram. in summary, the therapeutic effect of clozapine in reversing ppi impairment was mimicked by the h(1) antagonist pyrilamine, while pyrilamine had a mixed effect on cognition. pyrilamine impaired working memory but improved reference memory in rats. thus, h(1) antagonism seems to play a role in part of the beneficial actions of antipsychotics, such as clozapine.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ inhibition of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in developing rat brain by maternal exposure to ethanol. phosphatidylserine (ptdser), major acidic phospholipids in neuronal membranes, participate in important cell signaling processes. the ptdser in brain is highly enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (dha; 22:6n-3), and the dha status or ethanol exposure has been shown to influence the ptdser level. this study shows that ethanol exposure during prenatal and developmental period significantly attenuates microsomal ptdser biosynthetic activities and reduces ptdser, particularly 18:0, 22:6-ptdser, in developing rat brain cortices. brain microsomes were incubated with deuterium labeled exogenous substrates in vitro and the products formed were detected by reversed phase hplc-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms). these in vitro bioassays showed that 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl (18:0, 22:6) species is the best substrate for ptdser synthesis from both phosphatidylcholine (ptdcho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (ptdetn). the ptdser biosynthetic activity of brain, especially for 18:0, 22:6-ptdser production, was hampered significantly by maternal exposure to ethanol. ptdser levels were consistently reduced significantly in brain cortices of the pups from ethanol-exposed dams, due mainly to the depletion of 18:0, 22:6-ptdser. the mrna expression of ptdser synthase 1 (pss1) and ptdser synthase 2 (pss2) was not reduced by ethanol. similarly, the pss1 enzyme level did not change after ethanol exposure but pss2 could not be probed with the antibody available currently. degradation of ptdser by mitochondrial ptdser decarboxylation was not enhanced but also inhibited. taken together, attenuated ptdser biosynthetic activities are largely responsible for the ptdser reduction observed in developing rat brains after maternal exposure to ethanol.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ regulation of gluconeogenesis by kruppel-like factor 15. in the postabsorptive state, certain tissues, including the brain, require glucose as the sole source of energy. after an overnight fast, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis becomes essential for preventing life-threatening hypoglycemia. mice with a targeted deletion of klf15, a member of the kruppel-like family of transcription factors, display severe hypoglycemia after an overnight (18 hr) fast. we provide evidence that defective amino acid catabolism promotes the development of fasting hypoglycemia in klf15-/- mice by limiting gluconeogenic substrate availability. klf15-/- liver and skeletal muscle show markedly reduced mrna expression of amino acid-degrading enzymes. furthermore, the enzymatic activity of alanine aminotransferase (alt), which converts the critical gluconeogenic amino acid alanine into pyruvate, is decreased (approximately 50%) in klf15-/- hepatocytes. consistent with this observation, intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate, but not alanine, rescues fasting hypoglycemia in klf15-/- mice. we conclude that klf15 plays an important role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ discovery of acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase 2 inhibitors: comparison of a fluorescence intensity-based phosphate assay and a fluorescence polarization-based adp assay for high-throughput screening. acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase (acc) enzymes exist as two isoforms, acc1 and acc2, which play critical roles in fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation. though each isoform differs in tissue and subcellular localization, both catalyze the biotin- and atp-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-coenzyme a to generate malonyl-coenzyme a, a key metabolite in the control of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. the cytosolic acc1 is expressed primarily in liver and adipose tissue, and uses malonyl-coenzyme a as a key building block in fatty acid biosynthesis. the mitochondrial acc2 is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, where it is involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. inhibitors of acc enzymes may therefore be useful therapeutics for diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. two assay formats for these atp-utilizing enzymes amenable to high-throughput screening are compared: a fluorescence intensity-based assay to detect inorganic phosphate and a fluorescence polarization-based assay to detect adp. acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase inhibitors were identified by these high-throughput screening methods and were confirmed in a radiometric high performance liquid chromatography assay of malonyl-coenzyme a production.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

[n-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1h-pyrazole-3-carboxyamide] (sr 141716a), a selective cannabinoid cb1 receptor antagonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pvn) of male rats, induces penile erection. this effect is mediated by the release of glutamic acid, which in turn activates central oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. double immunofluorescence studies with selective antibodies against cb1 receptors, glutamic acid transporters (vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (vglut1 and vglut2), glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (gad67) and oxytocin itself, have shown that cb1 receptors in the pvn are located mainly in gabaergic terminals and fibers surrounding oxytocinergic cell bodies. as gabaergic synapses in the pvn impinge directly on oxytocinergic neurons or on excitatory glutamatergic synapses, which also impinge on oxytocinergic neurons, these results suggest that the blockade of cb1 receptors decreases gaba release in the pvn, increasing in turn glutamatergic neurotransmission to activate oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. autoradiography studies with [(3)h](-)-cp 55,940 show that chronic treatment with sr 141716a for 15 days twice daily (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increases the density of cb1 receptors in the pvn. this increase occurs concomitantly with an almost twofold increase in the pro-erectile effect of sr 141716a injected into the pvn as compared with control rats. the present findings confirm that pvn cb1 receptors, localized mainly in gabaergic synapses that control in an inhibitory fashion excitatory synapses, exert an inhibitory control on penile erection, demonstrating for the first time that chronic blockade of cb1 receptors by sr 141716a increases the density of these receptors in the pvn. this increase is related to an enhanced pro-erectile effect of sr 141716a, which is still present 3 days after the end of the chronic treatment.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ multiple rat brain calpastatin forms are produced by distinct starting points and alternative splicing of the n-terminal exons. 5'-race was performed on rat brain calpastatin mrna and two new translation initiation atg's were found. the first one is upstream of the previously designed initiation translation site localized in the rat calpastatin l-domain. the deduced protein sequence of this region is highly homologous to the xl-domain of calpastatin type i in other species. the other atg has not previously been reported and is localized in exon 8, thus originating a calpastatin isoform constituted only by four repetitive inhibitory units without the xl-l-domains. transcripts from the rat brain calpastatin gene are also subjected to multiple splicing events involving exons 4, 6, 8 in different combinations. a series of recombinant calpastatin forms was produced that differed in the exons present in the l-domain, and all the variants showed comparable inhibitory efficiency against calpain. it was concluded that the presence of the xl-domain in these isoforms is not relevant for the formation of the calpain/calpastatin complex in the absence of calcium, that is the interaction of calpastatin with inactive calpain. using exon-specific antisera, specific calpastatin protein isoforms containing the xl-domain have been detected in rat brain homogenates.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ characterization of the nitrosyl adduct of substrate-bound mouse cysteine dioxygenase by electron paramagnetic resonance: electronic structure of the active site and mechanistic implications. mammalian cysteine dioxygenase (cdo) is a non-heme iron metalloenzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in oxidative cysteine catabolism. the active site coordination of cdo comprises a mononuclear iron ligated by the nepsilon atoms of three protein-derived histidines, thus representing a new variant on the 2-histidine-1-carboxylate (2h1c) facial triad motif. nitric oxide was used as a spectroscopic probe in investigating the order of substrate-o2 binding by epr spectroscopy. in these experiments, cdo exhibits an ordered binding of l-cysteine prior to no (and presumably o2) similar to that observed for the 2h1c class of non-heme iron enzymes. moreover, the cdo active site is essentially unreactive toward no in the absence of substrate, suggesting an obligate ordered binding of l-cysteine prior to no. typically, addition of no to a mononuclear non-heme iron center results in the formation of an {feno}7 (s = 3/2) species characterized by an axial epr spectrum with gx, gy, and gz values of approximately 4, approximately 4, and approximately 2, respectively. however, upon addition of no to cdo in the presence of substrate l-cysteine, a low-spin {feno}7 (s = 1/2) signal that accounts for approximately 85% of the iron within the enzyme develops. similar {feno}7 (s = 1/2) epr signals have been observed for a variety of octahedral mononuclear iron-nitrosyl synthetic complexes; however, this type of iron-nitrosyl species is not commonly observed for non-heme iron enzymes. substitution of l-cysteine with isosteric substrate analogues cysteamine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and propane thiol did not produce any analogous {feno}7 signals (s = 1/2 or 3/2), thus reflecting the high substrate specificity of the enzyme observed by a number of researchers. the unusual {feno}7 (s = 1/2) electronic configuration adopted by the substrate-bound iron-nitrosyl cdo (termed {es-no}7) is a result of the bidentate thiol/amine coordination of l-cysteine in the no-bound cdo active site. dft computations were performed to further characterize this species. the dft-predicted geometric parameters for {es-no}7 are in good agreement with the crystallographically determined substrate-bound active site configuration of cdo and are consistent with known iron-nitrosyl model complexes. moreover, the computed epr parameters (g and a values) are in excellent agreement with experimental results for this cdo species and those obtained from comparable synthetic {feno}7 (s = 1/2) iron-nitrosyl complexes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ sunitinib, sorafenib and mtor inhibitors in renal cancer. understanding the alterations in cellular protein interactions and their relations to genetic mutations that cause renal cell carcinoma (rcc) provides a unique opportunity for the development of disease-specific therapy for patients with advanced forms of this disease. there is substantial evidence of an association between mutation on von hippel-lindau (vhl) gene and the earliest stages of tumorigenesis of rcc. the main consequence of vhl loss is the upregulation of downstream proangiogenic factors leading to highly vascular tumors. overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor (hif) is also caused by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), a key component of signaling pathways inside the cell, involved in cell proliferation. the inhibition of proangiogenic factors and mtor was the main idea behind the development of new targeted agents in advanced rcc. since december 2005, 3 targeted agents have been approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of advanced rcc: sorafenib, sunitinib and temsirolimus. sorafenib and sunitinib are synthetic, orally active agents shown to directly inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptors -2 and -3 (vegfr-2, vegfr-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (pdgfr-beta), while temsirolimus is an mtor inhibitor. recent clinical studies form the basis for new guidelines for the treatment of advanced rcc: sorafenib should be used as a second-line treatment, sunitinib as the first-line therapy for good and intermediate-risk patients, and temsirolimus should be considered as first-line treatment for poor-risk patients. future approaches to targeted therapy should focus on optimizing the use of current active drugs, exploring their combinations or investigating their sequential use. in addition, it is important to define the mechanisms of resistance on their use and to further investigate biomarkers and enhance treatment efficacy for the individual patients. the development of these targeted therapies represents an exciting step forward in the treatment of advanced rcc.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ management of psoriasis: the position of retinoid drugs. oral synthetic retinoids have been established as effective systemic therapy for psoriasis since their introduction for clinical use in the 1970s; a compound for topical use, tazarotene has been recently marketed. despite the demonstrated clinical success of retinoid therapy in psoriasis, its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, and investigators are confronted with two paradoxes. one is that the binding of retinoids to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (rars) does not match their therapeutic efficacy: acitretin activates the three receptor subtypes, rar-alpha, -beta and -gamma, without measurable receptor binding, whereas tazarotene preferentially binds to and activates rar-beta and -gamma in preference to rar-alpha. the other is that there is already increased formation of retinoic acid in the psoriatic lesion. answering these questions should result in better use of these drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. oral administration of acitretin remains one of the first therapeutic choices for severe psoriasis, particularly in association with ultraviolet light therapy, of which it may decrease the carcinogenic risk. topical tazarotene is suitable for moderate plaque psoriasis. its efficacy and tolerability can be enhanced by the addition of topical corticosteroids; its irritative potential is counterbalanced by a sustained therapeutic effect after the treatment is stopped.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ comprehensive review of rasagiline, a second-generation monoamine oxidase inhibitor, for the treatment of parkinson's disease. background: inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (mao) with selectivity and specificity for mao type b (mao-b) prolong the duration of action of both endogenously and exogenously derived dopamine. rasagiline [n-propargyl-l(r)-aminoindan] is a second-generation propargylamine pharmacophore that selectively and irreversibly inhibits brain mao-b and is specifically designed for the treatment of parkinson's disease (pd). objective: the aim of this study was to review the pharmacology, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of rasagiline in the treatment of pd. methods: medline (1966-april 2007), the cochrane database of systematic reviews, and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-april 2007) were searched for original research and review articles published in english. the search terms were monoamine oxidase, neuroprotection, parkinson disease, propargylamine, rasagiline, and selegiline. the reference lists of articles were also consulted, as was information provided by the manufacturer of rasagiline. results: data from 63 clinical and laboratory studies were analyzed. based on the results from those studies, we concluded that rasagiline po qd, at the therapeutic dosage range of 0.5 to 1 rag/d, is effective and well tolerated and completely, selectively, and specifically inhibited mao-b. pharmacologically, rasagiline was found to be < or =10-fold more potent than selegiline and was not metabolized to amphetamine derivatives. rasagiline was effective both as monotherapy in early pd and as adjunctive treatment in patients with advancing pd and motor fluctuations. as monotherapy, rasagiline provided modest yet clinically meaningful benefit. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that, after 26 weeks of treatment, the adjusted effect size for total unified parkinson's disease rating scale score was -4.20 (95% ci, -5.66 to -2.73) for rasagiline 1 mg/d versus placebo (p < 0.001). preliminary long-term data from an open-label study suggest a sustained therapeutic advantage when rasagiline is initiated early (before the need for dopaminergic agents) rather than later. in patients with more advanced disease who received treatment with dopaminergic agents, rasagiline and entacapone were associated with reductions of "off" time significantly greater than placebo (-1.18 and -1.2 vs 0.4 hour; both, p < or = 0.001). rasagiline was well tolerated in younger (aged <;70 years) and older (aged > or =70 years) patients with early or advanced pd. pharmacologically, rasagiline has the potential to augment the vasopressor effects of diet-derived tyramine (ie, the "cheese reaction"). however, clinical challenge studies of tyramine have found this unlikely to occur even with ingestion of supraphysiologic amounts of tyramine. in experimental models, rasagiline has been found to have neuroprotective properties that may be independent of mao-b inhibition. conclusions: based on this review, rasagiline has been found to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of early pd and as adjunctive treatment in motor fluctuations. whether rasagiline is associated with clinically significant neuroprotection (ie, disease modification) in pd is the subject of ongoing clinical trials.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ mutation of gly721 alters dna topoisomerase i active site architecture and sensitivity to camptothecin. dna topoisomerase i (top1p) catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled dna via a concerted mechanism of dna strand cleavage and religation. top1p is the cellular target of the anti-cancer drug camptothecin (cpt), which reversibly stabilizes a covalent enzyme-dna intermediate. top1p clamps around duplex dna, wherein the core and c-terminal domains are connected by extended alpha-helices (linker domain), which position the active site tyr of the c-terminal domain within the catalytic pocket. the physical connection of the linker with the top1p clamp as well as linker flexibility affect enzyme sensitivity to cpt. crystallographic data reveal that a conserved gly residue (located at the juncture between the linker and c-terminal domains) is at one end of a short alpha-helix, which extends to the active site tyr covalently linked to the dna. in the presence of drug, the linker is rigid and this alpha-helix extends to include gly and the preceding leu. we report that mutation of this conserved gly in yeast top1p alters enzyme sensitivity to cpt. mutating gly to asp, glu, asn, gln, leu, or ala enhanced enzyme cpt sensitivity, with the acidic residues inducing the greatest increase in drug sensitivity in vivo and in vitro. by contrast, val or phe substituents rendered the enzyme cpt-resistant. mutation-induced alterations in enzyme architecture preceding the active site tyr suggest these structural transitions modulate enzyme sensitivity to cpt, while enhancing the rate of dna cleavage. we postulate that this conserved gly residue provides a flexible hinge within the top1p catalytic pocket to facilitate linker dynamics and the structural alterations that accompany drug binding of the covalent enzyme-dna intermediate.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ characterization of the substrate mimic bound to engineered prostacyclin synthase in solution using high-resolution nmr spectroscopy and mutagenesis: implication of the molecular mechanism in biosynthesis of prostacyclin. high-resolution nmr spectroscopy was used to determine the docking of a substrate (prostaglandin h2) mimic (u46619) to the engineered prostacyclin (pgi2) synthase (pgis) in solution. the binding of u46619 to the pgis protein was demonstrated by 1d nmr titration, and the significant perturbation of the chemical shifts of protons at c-11, h2c, and h20 of u46619 were observed upon u46619 binding to the engineered pgis in a concentration-dependent manner. the detailed conformational change and 3d structure of the pgis-bound u46619 were further demonstrated by 2d 1h nmr experiments using the transferred noe technique. the distances between the protons h20 and h2, h18 and h2, and h18 and h4 are shorter following their binding to the pgis in solution-down to within 5 a. these shorter distances resulted in a widely open conformation, where the triangle shape of the unbound u46619 changed to a more compact conformation with an oval shape. the bound conformation of u46619 fits the crystal structure of the pgis substrate binding pocket considerably better than that of the unbound u46619. the residues important to the substrate binding in the active site pocket of pgis were also predicted. for example, trp282 could be one of the most important residues and is suspected to play a role in the determination of specific catalytic function, which has been established by the docking studies using the nmr structure of the pgis-bound form of u46619 and the pgis crystal structure. these studies have provided the structural information for the interaction of the pgis with its substrate mimic. the noted conformational changes where the c-6 position is closer to the c-9 position of u46619 provided the first experimental data for understanding the molecular mechanism of the catalytic function of pgis in the isomerization of pgh2 to prostacyclin.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ high-affinity blockade of voltage-operated skeletal muscle and neuronal sodium channels by halogenated propofol analogues. background and purpose: voltage-operated sodium channels constitute major target sites for local anaesthetic-like action. the clinical use of local anaesthetics is still limited by severe side effects, in particular, arrhythmias and convulsions. these side effects render the search for new local anaesthetics a matter of high interest. experimental approach: we have investigated the effects of three halogenated structural analogues of propofol on voltage-operated human skeletal muscle sodium channels (na(v)1.4) and the effect of one compound (4-chloropropofol) on neuronal sodium channels (na(v)1.2) heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cell line 293. key results: 4-iodo-, 4-bromo- and 4-chloropropofol reversibly suppressed depolarization-induced whole-cell sodium inward currents with high potency. the ic(50) for block of resting channels at -150 mv was 2.3, 3.9 and 11.3 microm in na(v)1.4, respectively, and 29.2 microm for 4-chloropropofol in na(v)1.2. membrane depolarization inducing inactivation strongly increased the blocking potency of all compounds. estimated affinities for the fast-inactivated channel state were 81 nm, 312 nm and 227 nm for 4-iodopropofol, 4-bromopropofol and 4-chloropropofol in na(v)1.4, and 450 nm for 4-chloropropofol in na(v)1.2. recovery from fast inactivation was prolonged in the presence of drug leading to an accumulation of block during repetitive stimulation at high frequencies (100 hz). conclusions and implications: halogenated propofol analogues constitute a novel class of sodium channel-blocking drugs possessing almost 100-fold higher potency compared with the local anaesthetic and anti-arrhythmic drug lidocaine. preferential drug binding to inactivated channel states suggests that halogenated propofol analogues might be especially effective in suppressing ectopic discharges in a variety of pathological conditions.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ dna damage and homologous recombination signaling induced by thymidylate deprivation. dna damage is accepted as a consequence of thymidylate deprivation induced by chemotherapeutic inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (ts), but the types of damage and signaling responses remain incompletely understood. thymidylate deprivation increases dutp and uracil in dna, which is removed by base excision repair (ber). because ber requires a synthesis step, strand break intermediates presumably accumulate. thymidylate deprivation also induces cell cycle arrest during replication. homologous recombination (hr) is a means of repairing persistent ber intermediates and collapsed replication forks. there are also intimate links between hr and s-phase checkpoint pathways. in this study, the goals were to determine the involvement of hr-associated proteins and dna damage signaling responses to thymidylate deprivation. when rad51, which is a central component of hr, was depleted by sirna cells were sensitized to raltitrexed (rtx), which specifically inhibits ts. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in mammalian cells that depletion of rad51 causes sensitivity to thymidylate deprivation. activation of dna damage signaling responses was examined following treatment with rtx. phosphorylation of replication protein a (rpa2 subunit) and formation of damage-induced foci were strikingly evident following ic(50) doses of rtx. induction was much more striking following rtx treatment than with hydroxyurea, which is commonly used to inhibit replication. rtx treatment also induced foci of rad51, gamma-h2ax, phospho-chk1, and phospho-nbs1, although the extent of co-localization with rpa2 foci varied. collectively, the results suggest that hr and s-phase checkpoint signaling processes are invoked by thymidylate deprivation and influence cellular resistance to thymidylate deprivation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(+)-[(3)h]isradipine binding to ca(v)1.2dhp(-/-) and ca(v)-dm brains was reduced to 15.1 and 4.4% of wild type, respectively, indicating that ca(v)1.3 accounts for 10.7% of brain ltccs. qpcr revealed that ca(v)1.1 and ca(v)1.4 alpha(1) subunits comprised 0.08% of the ltcc transcripts in mouse whole brain, suggesting that they cannot account for the residual binding. instead, this could be explained by low-affinity binding (127-fold k(d) increase) to the mutated ca(v)1.2 channels. inhibition of (+)-[(3)h]isradipine binding to ca(v)1.2dhp(-/-) (predominantly ca(v)1.3) and wild-type (predominantly ca(v)1.2) brain membranes by unlabeled dhps revealed a 3- to 4-fold selectivity of nitrendipine and nifedipine for the ca(v)1.2 binding pocket, a finding further confirmed with heterologously expressed channels. this suggests that small differences in their binding pockets may allow development of isoform-selective modulators for ltccs and that, because of their very low expression, ca(v)1.1 and ca(v)1.4 are unlikely to serve as drug targets to treat cns diseases.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ tyrosine kinase blockers: new hope for successful cancer therapy. tyrosine kinases (tks) are attractive targets for cancer therapy, as quite often their abnormal signaling has been linked with tumor development and growth. constitutive activated tks stimulate multiple signaling pathways responsible for dna repair, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. during the last few years, thorough analysis of the mechanism underlying tyrosine kinase's activity led to novel cancer therapy using tks blockers. these drugs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human tumors including head and neck, gastric, prostate and breast cancer and leukemias. the most successful example of kinase blockers is imatinib (imatinib mesylate, gleevec, sti571), the inhibitor of bcr/abl oncoprotein, which has become a first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. the introduction of sti571 for the treatment of leukemia in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on how this disease is currently managed. others kinase inhibitors used recently in cancer therapy include dasatinib (bms-354825) specific for abl non-receptor cytoplasmic kinase, gefitinib (iressa), erlotinib (osi-774, tarceva) and sunitinib (su 11248, sutent) specific for vegf receptor kinase, amn107 (nilotinib) and inno-406 (ns-187) specific for c-kit kinase. the following tk blockers for treatment of various human tumors are in clinical development: lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate, tykerb, gw-572016), canertinib (ci-1033), zactima (zd6474), vatalanib (ptk787/zk 222584), sorafenib (bay 43-9006, nexavar), and leflunomide (su101, arava). herein, we discuss the chemistry, biological activity and clinical potential of new drugs with tyrosine kinase blockers for cancer treatment.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ atomoxetine: a review of its use in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents. atomoxetine (strattera(r)) is a selective norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor that is not classified as a stimulant, and is indicated for use in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). atomoxetine is effective and generally well tolerated. it is significantly more effective than placebo and standard current therapy and does not differ significantly from or is noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate; however, it is significantly less effective than the extended-release methylphenidate formulation oros(r) methylphenidate (hereafter referred to as osmotically released methylphenidate) and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. atomoxetine can be administered either as a single daily dose or split into two evenly divided doses, has a negligible risk of abuse or misuse, and is not a controlled substance in the us. atomoxetine is particularly useful for patients at risk of substance abuse, as well as those who have co-morbid anxiety or tics, or who do not wish to take a controlled substance. thus, atomoxetine is a useful option in the treatment of adhd in children and adolescents. the mechanism of action of atomoxetine is unclear, but is thought to be related to its selective inhibition of presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake in the prefrontal cortex. atomoxetine has a high affinity and selectivity for norepinephrine transporters, but little or no affinity for various neurotransmitter receptors. atomoxetine has a demonstrated ability to selectively inhibit norepinephrine uptake in humans and animals, and studies have shown that it preferentially binds to areas of known high distribution of noradrenergic neurons, such as the fronto-cortical subsystem. atomoxetine was generally associated with statistically, but not clinically, significant increases in both heart rate and blood pressure in pediatric patients with adhd. while there was an initial loss in expected height and weight among atomoxetine recipients, this eventually returned to normal in the longer term. data suggest that atomoxetine is unlikely to have any abuse potential. atomoxetine appeared less likely than methylphenidate to exacerbate disordered sleep in pediatric patients with adhd. atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed, and demonstrates dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure. it undergoes extensive biotransformation, which is affected by poor metabolism by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2d6 in a small percentage of the population; these patients have greater exposure to and slower elimination of atomoxetine than extensive metabolizers. patients with hepatic insufficiency show an increase in atomoxetine exposure. cyp2d6 inhibitors, such as paroxetine, are associated with changes in atomoxetine pharmacokinetics similar to those observed among poor cyp2d6 metabolizers. once- or twice-daily atomoxetine was effective in the short-term treatment of adhd in children and adolescents, as observed in several well designed placebo-controlled trials. atomoxetine also demonstrated efficacy in the longer term treatment of these patients. a single morning dose was shown to be effective into the evening, and discontinuation of atomoxetine was not associated with symptom rebound. atomoxetine efficacy did not appear to differ between children and adolescents. stimulant-naive patients also responded well to atomoxetine treatment. atomoxetine did not differ significantly from or was noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate in children and adolescents with adhd with regard to efficacy, and was significantly more effective than standard current therapy (any combination of medicines [excluding atomoxetine] and/or behavioral counseling, or no treatment). however, atomoxetine was significantly less effective than osmotically released methylphenidate and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. the efficacy of atomoxetine did not appear to be affected by the presence of co-morbid disorders, and symptoms of the co-morbid disorders were not affected or were improved by atomoxetine administration. health-related quality of life (hr-qol) appeared to be positively affected by atomoxetine in both short- and long-term studies; atomoxetine also improved hr-qol to a greater extent than standard current therapy. atomoxetine was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with adhd. common adverse events included headache, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, somnolence, and nausea. the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate; there was a very low incidence of serious adverse events. few patients discontinued atomoxetine treatment because of adverse events. atomoxetine discontinuation appeared to be well tolerated, with a low incidence of discontinuation-emergent adverse events. atomoxetine appeared better tolerated among extensive cyp2d6 metabolizers than among poor metabolizers. slight differences were evident in the adverse event profiles of atomoxetine and stimulants, both immediate- and extended-release. somnolence appeared more common among atomoxetine recipients and insomnia appeared more common among stimulant recipients. a black-box warning for suicidal ideation has been published in the us prescribing information, based on findings from a meta-analysis showing that atomoxetine is associated with a significantly higher incidence of suicidal ideation than placebo. rarely, atomoxetine may also be associated with serious liver injury; postmarketing data show that three patients have had liver-related adverse events deemed probably related to atomoxetine treatment. treatment algorithms involving the initial use of atomoxetine appear cost effective versus algorithms involving initial methylphenidate (immediate- or extended-release), dexamfetamine, tricyclic antidepressants, or no treatment in stimulant-naive, -failed, and -contraindicated children and adolescents with adhd. the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year is below commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, as shown in several markov model analyses conducted from the perspective of various european countries, with a time horizon of 1 year.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ novel inhibitors complexed with glutamate dehydrogenase: allosteric regulation by control of protein dynamics. mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) is a homohexameric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of l-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate using nad(p)(+) as coenzyme. unlike its counterparts from other animal kingdoms, mammalian gdh is regulated by a host of ligands. the recently discovered hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia disorder showed that the loss of allosteric inhibition of gdh by gtp causes excessive secretion of insulin. subsequent studies demonstrated that wild-type and hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia forms of gdh are inhibited by the green tea polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate. this was followed by high throughput studies that identified more stable inhibitors, including hexachlorophene, gw5074, and bithionol. shown here are the structures of gdh complexed with these three compounds. hexachlorophene forms a ring around the internal cavity in gdh through aromatic stacking interactions between the drug and gdh as well as between the drug molecules themselves. in contrast, gw5074 and bithionol both bind as pairs of stacked compounds at hexameric 2-fold axes between the dimers of subunits. the internal core of gdh contracts when the catalytic cleft closes during enzymatic turnover. none of the drugs cause conformational changes in the contact residues, but all bind to key interfaces involved in this contraction process. therefore, it seems likely that the drugs inhibit enzymatic turnover by inhibiting this transition. indeed, this expansion/contraction process may play a major role in the inter-subunit communication and allosteric regulation observed in gdh.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ breast cancer and steroid metabolizing enzymes: the role of progestogens. it is well documented that breast tissue, both normal and cancerous, contains all the enzymatic systems necessary for the bioformation and metabolic transformation of estrogens, androgens and progesterone. these include sulfatases, aromatase, hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenases, sulfotransferases, hydroxylases and glucuronidases. the control of these enzymes plays an important role in the development and pathogenesis of hormone-dependent breast cancer. as discussed in this review, various progestogens including dydrogesterone and its 20alpha-dihydro-derivative, medrogestone, promegestone, nomegestrol acetate and norelgestromin can reduce intratissular levels of estradiol in breast cancer by blocking sulfatase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 1 activities. a possible correlation has been postulated between breast cell proliferation and estrogen sulfotransferase activity. progesterone is largely transformed in the breast; normal breast produces mainly 4-ene derivatives, whereas 5alpha-derivatives are most common in breast cancer tissue. it has been suggested that this specific conversion of progesterone may be involved in breast carcinogenesis. in conclusion, treatment with anti-aromatases combined with anti-sulfatase or 17beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 1 could provide new therapeutic possibilities in the treatment of patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ a molecular mechanism for ibuprofen-mediated rhoa inhibition in neurons. ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used to relieve pain and inflammation in many disorders via inhibition of cyclooxygenases. recently, we have demonstrated that ibuprofen inhibits intracellular signaling of rhoa and promotes significant axonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. in addition, another study suggests that ibuprofen reduces generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of rhoa signaling, although it may also regulate amyloid-beta42 formation by direct inhibition of the gamma-secretase complex. the molecular mechanisms by which ibuprofen inhibits the rhoa signal in neurons, however, remain unclear. here, we report that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppargamma) is essential for coupling ibuprofen to rhoa inhibition and subsequent neurite growth promotion in neurons. ibuprofen activates ppargamma in neuron-like pc12 and b104 cells. activation of ppargamma with traditional agonists mimics the rhoa-inhibiting properties of ibuprofen in pc12 cells and, like ibuprofen, promotes neurite elongation in primary cultured neurons exposed to axonal growth inhibitors. protein knockdown with small interfering rna specific for ppargamma blocks rhoa suppression of ppargamma agonists in pc12 cells. moreover, the effect of ibuprofen on rhoa activity and neurite growth in neuronal cultures is prevented by selective ppargamma inhibition. these findings support that ppargamma plays an essential role in mediating the rhoa-inhibiting effect of ibuprofen. elucidation of the novel molecular mechanisms linking ibuprofen to rhoa inhibition may provide additional therapeutic targets to the disorders characterized by rhoa activation, including spinal cord injuries and alzheimer's disease.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ a dilated cardiomyopathy troponin c mutation lowers contractile force by reducing strong myosin-actin binding. in this study we explore the mechanisms by which a double mutation (e59d/d75y) in cardiac troponin c (ctnc) associated with dilated cardiomyopathy reduces the ca(2+)-activated maximal tension of cardiac muscle. studying the single mutants (i.e. e59d or d75y) indicates that d75y, but not e59d, causes a reduction in the calcium affinity of ctnc in troponin complex, regulated thin filaments (rtf), and the ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction and atpase in cardiac muscle preparations. however, both d75y and e59d are required to reduce the actomyosin atpase activity and maximal force in muscle fibers, indicating that e59d enhances the effects of d75y. part of the reduction in force/atpase may be due to a defect in the interactions between ctnc and cardiac troponin t, which are known to be necessary for atpase activation. an additional mechanism for the reduction in force/atpase comes from measurements of the binding stoichiometry of myosin subfragment-1 (s-1) to the rtf. using wild type rtfs, 4.8 mol s-1 was bound per mol filament (seven actins), whereas with e59d/d75y rtfs, the number of binding sites was reduced by approximately 23% to 3.7. altogether, these results suggest that the reduction in force and atpase activation is possibly due to a thin filament conformation that promotes fewer accessible s-1-binding sites. in the absence of any family segregation data, the functional results presented here support the concept that this is likely a dilated cardiomyopathy-causing mutation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ new standards in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management: focus on telmisartan. blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is an important approach in managing high blood pressure, and has increasingly been shown to affect cardiovascular disease processes mediated by angiotensin ii throughout the cardiovascular and renal continua. telmisartan is an angiotensin ii receptor blocker (arb) displaying unique pharmacologic properties, including a longer half life than any other arb, that result in large and sustained reductions of blood pressure. in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, telmisartan has proved superior to other antihypertensive agents (valsartan, losartan, ramipril, perindopril, and atenolol) in controlling blood pressure particularly towards the end of the dosing interval. there is also clinical evidence that telmisartan reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, reduces arterial stiffness and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and confers renoprotection. the ongoing telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial (ontarget) study has demonstrated that telmisartan has similar cardiovascular protective effects to ramipril in a large, high-risk patient population but was better tolerated. the powerful and sustained blood pressure control apparent in clinical trials, together with cardiovascular protection and tolerability demonstrated in ontarget means that telmisartan may be a preferred option for patients with hypertension.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ jostling for position: optimizing linker location in the design of estrogen receptor-targeting protacs. estrogen receptor-alpha (er) antagonists have been widely used for breast cancer therapy. despite initial responsiveness, hormone-sensitive er-positive cancer cells eventually develop resistance to er antagonists. it has been shown that in most of these resistant tumor cells, the er is expressed and continues to regulate tumor growth. recent studies indicate that tamoxifen initially acts as an antagonist, but later functions as an er agonist, promoting tumor growth. this suggests that targeted er degradation may provide an effective therapeutic approach for breast cancers, even those that are resistant to conventional therapies. with this in mind, we previously demonstrated that proteolysis targeting chimeras (protacs) effectively induce degradation of the er as a proof-of-concept experiment. herein we further refined the protac approach to target the er for degradation. the er-targeting protacs are composed of an estradiol on one end and a hypoxia-inducing factor 1alpha (hif-1alpha)-derived synthetic pentapeptide on the other. the pentapeptide is recognized by an e3 ubiquitin ligase called the von hippel lindau tumor suppressor protein (pvhl), thereby recruiting the er to this e3 ligase for ubiquitination and degradation. specifically, the pentapeptide is attached at three different locations on estradiol to generate three different protac types. with the pentapeptide linked through the c7alpha position of estradiol, the resulting protac shows the most effective er degradation and highest affinity for the estrogen receptor. this result provides an opportunity to develop a novel type of er antagonist that may overcome the resistance of breast tumors to conventional drugs such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant (faslodex).$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ the selectivity of beta-adrenoceptor agonists at human beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors. background and purpose: there are two important properties of receptor-ligand interactions: affinity (the ability of the ligand to bind to the receptor) and efficacy (the ability of the receptor-ligand complex to induce a response). ligands are classified as agonists or antagonists depending on whether or not they have efficacy. in theory, it is possible to develop selective agonists based on selective affinity, selective intrinsic efficacy or both. this study examined the affinity and intrinsic efficacy of 31 beta-adrenoceptor agonists at the three human beta-adrenoceptors to determine whether the current agonists are subtype selective because of affinity or intrinsic efficacy. experimental approach: stable clonal cho-k1 cell lines, transfected with either the human beta(1), beta(2) or beta(3)-adrenoceptor, were used, and whole-cell [(3)h]-cgp 12177 radioligand binding and [(3)h]-camp accumulation were measured. key results: several agonists were found to be highly subtype selective because of selective affinity (e.g. salmeterol and formoterol, for the beta(2)-adrenoceptor over the beta(1) or beta(3)), while others (e.g. isoprenaline) had little affinity-selectivity. however, the intrinsic efficacy of salmeterol, formoterol and isoprenaline was similar across all three receptor subtypes. other ligands (e.g. denopamine for beta(1); clenbuterol, az 40140d, salbutamol for beta(2)) were found to have subtype-selective intrinsic efficacy. several ligands appeared to activate two agonist conformations of the beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors. conclusions and implications: there are agonists with subtype selectivity based upon both selective affinity and selective intrinsic efficacy. therefore, there is scope to develop better selective agonists based upon both selective affinity and selective intrinsic efficacy.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ resistance to thyroid hormone due to a novel thyroid hormone receptor mutant in a patient with hypothyroidism secondary to lingual thyroid and functional characterization of the mutant receptor. background: we describe a rare case of congenital hypothyroidism and an extremely high serum thyrotropin (tsh) level caused by a combination of resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) and a lingual thyroid. as the rth mutant, r316c, was new, the optimum dose of levothyroxine was unclear. to aid in assessment of the therapy, we characterized the mutant r316c thyroid hormone receptor (tr) and compared it with a common mutant, r316h, using in vitro studies. summary: the patient was a newborn female having severe hypothyroidism with a free thyroxine level of 0.36 ng/dl and a serum tsh level of 177 microu/ml. a scintiscan showed ectopic lingual thyroid tissue without a normal thyroid gland. supplementation with levothyroxine at a dose of >350 microg/day did not normalize the serum tsh level; however, the patient showed normal growth and intelligence at 14 years of age. consistent with the results of a computer analysis, the binding of r316c to triiodothyronine (t3) was significantly decreased to 38% that of the wild type. electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that like r316h, r316c did not form a homodimer, but formed a heterodimer with rxr. however, a glutathione-s-transferase pull-down assay showed reduced binding of r316c with ncor in the absence of t3 and impaired release in the presence of t3. in addition, transient transfection experiments demonstrated that unlike r316h, r316c had severe impairment of transcriptional activity on genes both positively and negatively regulated by thyroid hormone. it also had a clear dominant negative effect on genes negatively, but not positively, regulated by thyroid hormone, including the tsh-releasing hormone and tshbeta genes. conclusion: this is the first reported case of a r316c tr mutation. the characteristics of the r316c mutant differed from those of the r316h mutant. our findings suggest that r316c causes reduced association with and impaired release of ncor, resulting in rth predominantly at the pituitary level, and that slightly elevated serum tsh level with high dose of levothyroxine might be optimum for normal growth.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ identification of neuronal target areas for nerve agents and specification of receptors for pharmacological treatment. in order to shorten the list of candidate drugs with anticonvulsant potential against nerve agents, critical subreceptors in seizure controlling brain regions should be specified. epileptiform activity does not spread randomly throughout the brain, but appears to be generated and propagated by specific anatomical routes. nerve agents evoke seizure activity in the forebrain that progresses to the hind brain resulting in tonic-clonic convulsions. in some recent studies, it was shown that lesion of the area tempestas (at), medial septum (ms), perirhinal cortex (prc), or posterior piriform cortex (ppc) produces anticonvulsant effects (prevention of convulsions or delayed onset of convulsions) in rats exposed to soman, whereas damage to nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis magnocellularis, amygdala, hippocampus, or entorhinal cortex does not cause anticonvulsant impact. these results are in compliance with findings that seizures can be generated in at, ms, prc, and ppc by means of nerve agents, chemoconvulsants, or kindling. results from microinfusion studies show that anticonvulsant efficacy is obtained by gaba(a) modulators or cholinergic antagonists (m1-m5) in at, cholinergic antagonists (m1-m5) in ms, combined glutamatergic (nmda) and cholinergic antagonist (m1-m4), ampa antagonist, or modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglur5, mglur2/3) in prc, and cholinergic antagonist (m1-m5) or gaba(a) agonist in ppc. calculation of impact factors for the most potent drugs (percentage of positive effects in the seizure controlling sites) showed that scopolamine and procyclidine were ranking highest (75) followed by muscimol (50), nbqx (33), and caramiphen (33). potential strategies for prophylactic and post-exposure treatments are discussed.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ gaba(a) receptors as molecular targets of general anesthetics: identification of binding sites provides clues to allosteric modulation. purpose: the purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge of detailed biochemical evidence for the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid type a receptors (gaba(a)-rs) in the mechanisms of general anesthesia. principal findings: with the knowledge that all general anesthetics positively modulate gaba(a)-r-mediated inhibitory transmission, site-directed mutagenesis comparing sequences of gaba(a)-r subunits of varying sensitivity led to identification of amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain that are critical for the drug actions in vitro. using a photo incorporable analogue of the general anesthetic, r(+)etomidate, we identified two transmembrane amino acids that were affinity labelled in purified bovine brain gaba(a)-r. homology protein structural modelling positions these two residues, alpham1-11' and betam3-4', close to each other in a single type of intersubunit etomidate binding pocket at the beta/alpha interface. this position would be appropriate for modulation of agonist channel gating. overall, available information suggests that these two etomidate binding residues are allosterically coupled to sites of action of steroids, barbiturates, volatile agents, and propofol, but not alcohols. residue alpha/betam2-15' is probably not a binding site but allosterically coupled to action of volatile agents, alcohols, and intravenous agents, and alpha/betam1-(-2') is coupled to action of intravenous agents. conclusions: establishment of a coherent and consistent structural model of the gaba(a)-r lends support to the conclusion that general anesthetics can modulate function by binding to appropriate domains on the protein. genetic engineering of mice with mutation in some of these gaba(a)-r residues are insensitive to general anesthetics in vivo, suggesting that further analysis of these domains could lead to development of more potent and specific drugs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ thiocolchicoside suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl and cancer cells through inhibition of inflammatory pathways: a new use for an old drug. background and purpose: most patients with cancer die not because of the tumour in the primary site, but because it has spread to other sites. common tumours, such as breast, multiple myeloma, and prostate tumours, frequently metastasize to the bone. to search for an inhibitor of cancer-induced bone loss, we investigated the effect of thiocolchicoside, a semi-synthetic colchicoside derived from the plant gloriosa superba and clinically used as a muscle relaxant, on osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand (rankl) and tumour cells. experimental approach: we used raw 264.7 (murine macrophage) cells, a well-established system for osteoclastogenesis, and evaluated the effect of thiocolchicoside on rankl-induced nf-kappab signalling and osteoclastogenesis as well as on osteoclastogenesis induced by tumour cells. key results: thiocolchicoside suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl, and by breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells. inhibition of the nf-kappab pathway was responsible for this effect since the colchicoside inhibited rankl-induced nf-kappab activation, activation of ikappab kinase (ikk) and suppressed inhibitor of nf-kappabalpha (ikappabalpha) phosphorylation and degradation, an inhibitor of nf-kappab. furthermore, an inhibitor of the ikappabalpha kinase gamma or nf-kappab essential modulator, the regulatory component of the ikk complex, demonstrated that the nf-kappab signalling pathway is mandatory for osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl. conclusions and implications: together, these data suggest that thiocolchicoside significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl and tumour cells via the nf-kappab signalling pathway. thus, thiocolchicoside, a drug that has been used for almost half a century to treat muscle pain, may also be considered as a new treatment for bone loss.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ mercury induces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) is a transcription factor that mediates the inducible expression of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. nf-κb activation induces numerous proinflammatory gene products including cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos). the divalent heavy metal mercury has been used for thousands of years. although mercury is clearly toxic to most mammalian organ systems, especially the immune system, exposure has still increased in some areas of the world. however, the underlying toxic mechanism is not clearly identified. here, we report biochemical evidence that mercury alone induces nf-κb activation, resulting in the induced expression of cox-2 and inos. the results suggest that mercury can induce inflammatory diseases by lowering host defense.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ pharmacological evidence of functional inhibitory metabotrophic glutamate receptors on mouse arousal-related cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental neurons. cholinergic neurons of the pontine laterodorsal tegmentum (ldt) are importantly involved in neurobiological mechanisms governing states of arousal such as sleep and wakefulness as well as other appetitive behaviors, such as drug-seeking. accordingly, mechanisms controlling their excitability are important to elucidate if we are to understand how these ldt neurons generate arousal states. glutamate mediates the vast majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate cns and while presence of glutamate input in the ldt has been shown and ionotropic responses to glutamate have been reported in the ldt, characterization of metabotropic responses is lacking. therefore, electrophysiological responses and changes in levels of intracellular ca(2+) in mouse cholinergic ldt neurons following application of specific mglur agonists and antagonists were examined. unexpectedly, both the mglur(5)specific agonist, chpg, and the group ii mglur (mglu(2/3)) agonist, ly379268 (ly), induced a ttx-insensitive outward current/hyperpolarization. both outward currents were significantly reduced by the mglur antagonist mcpg and the chpg-induced current was blocked by the specific mglur(5) antagonist mtep. concurrent ca(2+)imaging revealed that while chpg actions did include release of ca(2+) from cpa/thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores, actions of ly did not. both chpg- and ly-induced outward currents were mediated by a tea-sensitive potassium conductance. the large-conductance, ca(2+)-dependent potassium (bk) channel blocker, iberiotoxin, attenuated chpg actions. consistent with actions on the bk conductance, chpg enhanced the amplitude of the fast component of the after hyperpolarizing potential, concurrent with a reduction in the firing rate. we conclude that stimulation of mglur(5) and group ii (mglur(2/3)) elicits postsynaptically-mediated outward currents/hyperpolarizations in cholinergic ldt neurons. effects of glutamatergic input would be, thus, expected not only to be excitation via stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and mglur(1), but also inhibition via actions at mglur(5) and mglur(2/3) on these neurons. as these two processes counteract each other, these surprising findings necessitate revision of predictions regarding the net level of excitation generated by glutamate input to cholinergic ldt cells and, by extension, the functional outcome of glutamate transmission on processes which these neurons regulate. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'metabotropic glutamate receptors'.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ a potent chk1 inhibitor is selectively cytotoxic in melanomas with high levels of replicative stress. there are few effective treatments for metastatic melanoma. checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1) inhibitors are being trialled for their efficacy in enhancing conventional chemotherapeutic agents, but their effectiveness as single agents is not known. we have examined the effectiveness of two novel chk1 selective inhibitors, ar323 and ar678, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and normal cell types. we demonstrate that these drugs display single-agent activity, with ic50s in the low nanomolar range. the drugs produce cytotoxic effects in cell lines that are most sensitive to these drugs, whereas normal cells are only sensitive to these drugs at the higher concentrations where they have cytostatic activity. the cytotoxic effect is the consequence of inhibition of s-phase chk1, which drives cells prematurely from late s phase into an aberrant mitosis and results in either failure of cytokinesis or cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. the sensitivity to the chk1 inhibitors was correlated with the level of endogenous dna damage indicating replicative stress. chk1 inhibitors are viable single-agent therapies that target melanoma cells with high levels of endogenous dna damage. this sensitivity suggests that chk1 is a critical component of an adaptation to replicative stress in these cells. it also suggests that markers of dna damage may be useful in identifying the melanomas and potentially other tumour types that are more likely to be sensitive to chk1 inhibitors as single agents.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ oncogenic k-ras expression is associated with derangement of the camp/pka pathway and forskolin-reversible alterations of mitochondrial dynamics and respiration. the warburg effect in cancer cells has been proposed to involve several mechanisms, including adaptation to hypoxia, oncogenes activation or loss of oncosuppressors and impaired mitochondrial function. in previous papers, it has been shown that k-ras transformed mouse cells are much more sensitive as compared with normal cells to glucose withdrawal (undergoing apoptosis) and present a high glycolytic rate and a strong reduction of mitochondrial complex i. recent observations suggest that transformed cells have a derangement in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/camp-dependent protein kinase (camp/pka) pathway, which is known to regulate several mitochondrial functions. herein, the derangement of the camp/pka pathway and its impact on transformation-linked changes of mitochondrial functions is investigated. exogenous stimulation of pka activity, achieved by forskolin treatment, protected k-ras-transformed cells from apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation, enhanced complex i activity, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (atp) levels, mitochondrial fusion and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) levels. several of these effects were almost completely prevented by inhibiting the pka activity. short-time treatment with compounds favoring mitochondrial fusion strongly decreased the cellular ros levels especially in transformed cells. these findings support the notion that glucose shortage-induced apoptosis, specific of k-ras-transformed cells, is associated to a derangement of pka signaling that leads to mitochondrial complex i decrease, reduction of atp formation, prevalence of mitochondrial fission over fusion, and thereby opening new approaches for development of anticancer drugs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ tgf-β and nf-κb signal pathway cross-talk is mediated through tak1 and smad7 in a subset of head and neck cancers. transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β) has a dual role in epithelial malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). attenuation of canonical tgf-β signaling enhances de novo tumor development, whereas tgf-β overexpression and signaling paradoxically promotes malignant progression. we recently observed that tgf-β-induced growth arrest response is attenuated, in association with aberrant activation of nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb), a transcription factor, which promotes malignant progression in hnscc. however, what role cross-talk between components of the tgf-β and nf-κb pathways plays in altered activation of these pathways has not been established. here, we show tgf-β receptor ii and tgf-β-activated kinase 1 (tak1) are predominantly expressed in a subset of hnscc tumors with nuclear activation of nf-κb family member rela (p65). further, tgf-β1 treatment induced sequential phosphorylation of tak1, ikk, iκbα and rela in human hnscc lines. tak1 enhances tgf-β-induced nf-κb activation, as tak1 sirna knockdown decreased tgf-β1-induced phosphorylation of ikk, iκb and rela, degradation of iκbα, rela nuclear translocation and dna binding, and nf-κb-induced reporter and target gene transcription. functionally, tak1 sirna inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. celastrol, a tak1 inhibitor and anti-inflammatory compound used in traditional chinese medicine, also decreased tgf-β1-induced phosphorylation of tak1 and rela, and suppressed basal, tgf-β1- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α)-induced nf-κb reporter gene activity. celastrol also inhibited cell proliferation, while increasing sub-g0 dna fragmentation and annexin v markers of apoptosis. furthermore, tgf-β and rela activation promoted smad7 expression. in turn, smad7 preferentially suppressed tgf-β-induced smad and nf-κb reporters when compared with constitutive or tnf-α-induced nf-κb reporter gene activation. thus, cross-talk by tgf-β via tak1 and nf-κb promotes the malignant phenotype of hnscc. moreover, nf-κb may contribute to the downstream attenuation of canonical tgf-β signaling through increased smad7 expression. celastrol highlights the therapeutic potential of agents targeting tak1 as a key node in this pro-oncogenic tgf-β-nf-κb signal pathway.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ vitamin e deficiency impairs the somatostatinergic receptor-effector system and leads to phosphotyrosine phosphatase overactivation and cell death in the rat hippocampus. vitamin e plays an essential role in maintaining the structure and function of the nervous system, and its deficiency, commonly associated with fat malabsorption diseases, may reduce neuronal survival. we previously demonstrated that the somatostatinergic system, implicated in neuronal survival control, can be modulated by α-tocopherol in the rat dentate gyrus, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein phosphorylation. to gain a better understanding of the molecular actions of tocopherols and examine the link among vitamin e, somatostatin and neuronal survival, we have investigated the effects of a deficiency and subsequent administration of tocopherol on the somatostatin signaling pathway and neuronal survival in the rat hippocampus. no changes in somatostatin expression were detected in vitamin-e-deficient rats. these rats, however, showed a significant increase in the somatostatin receptor density and dissociation constant, which correlated with a significant increase in the protein levels of somatostatin receptors. nevertheless, vitamin e deficiency impaired the ability of the somatostatin receptors to couple to the effectors adenylyl cyclase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase by diminishing gi protein functionality. furthermore, vitamin e deficiency significantly increased phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and ptpη expression, as well as pkcδ activation, and decreased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. all these changes were accompanied by an increase in neuronal cell death. subsequent α-tocopherol administration partially or completely reversed all these values to control levels. altogether, our results prove the importance of vitamin e homeostasis in the somatostatin receptor-effector system and suggest a possible mechanism by which this vitamin may regulate the neuronal cell survival in the adult hippocampus.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ an overview of transcriptional regulation in response to toxicological insult. the completion of the human genome project and the subsequent advent of dna microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to a renaissance in molecular toxicology. toxicogenomic data sets, from both in vivo and in vitro studies, are growing exponentially, providing a wealth of information on regulation of stress pathways at the transcriptome level. through such studies, we are now beginning to appreciate the diversity and complexity of biological responses to xenobiotics. in this review, we aim to consolidate and summarise the major toxicologically relevant transcription factor-governed molecular pathways. it is becoming clear that different chemical entities can cause oxidative, genotoxic and proteotoxic stress, which induce cellular responses in an effort to restore homoeostasis. primary among the response pathways involved are nfe2l2 (nrf2), nfe2l1 (nrf1), p53, heat shock factor and the unfolded protein response. additionally, more specific mechanisms exist where xenobiotics act as ligands, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, metal-responsive transcription factor-1 and the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. other pathways including the immunomodulatory transcription factors nf-κb and stat together with the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor hif are also implicated in cellular responses to xenobiotic exposure. a less specific but equally important aspect to cellular injury controlled by transcriptional activity is loss of tissue-specific gene expression, resulting in dedifferentiation of target cells and compromise of tissue function. here, we review these pathways and the genes they regulate in order to provide an overview of this growing field of molecular toxicology.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ effects of silver nanoparticles on the liver and hepatocytes in vitro. with the increasing use and incorporation of nanoparticles (nps) into consumer products, screening for potential toxicity is necessary to ensure customer safety. nps have been shown to translocate to the bloodstream following inhalation and ingestion, and such studies demonstrate that the liver is an important organ for accumulation. silver (ag) nps are highly relevant for human exposure due to their use in food contact materials, dietary supplements, and antibacterial wound treatments. due to the large number of different nps already used in various products and being developed for new applications, it is essential that relevant, quick, and cheap methods of in vitro risk assessment suitable for these new materials are established. therefore, this study used a simple hepatocytes model combined with an in vivo injection model to simulate the passage of a small amount of nps into the bloodstream following exposure, e.g., via ingestion or inhalation, and examined the potential of ag nps of 20 nm diameter to cause toxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the liver following in vivo exposures of female wistar rats via iv injection to 50 μg of nps and in vitro exposures using the human hepatocyte cell line c3a. we found that ag nps were highly cytotoxic to hepatocytes (lc(50) lactate dehydrogenase: 2.5 μg/cm(2)) and affected hepatocyte homeostasis by reducing albumin release. at sublethal concentrations with normal cell or tissue morphology, ag nps were detected in cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes. we observed similar effects of ag nps on inflammatory mediator expression in vitro and in vivo with increase of interleukin-8 (il-8)/macrophage inflammatory protein 2, il-1ri, and tumor necrosis factor-α expression in both models and increased il-8 protein release in vitro. this article presents evidence of the potential toxicity and inflammogenic potential of ag nps in the liver following ingestion. in addition, the similarities between in vitro and in vivo responses are striking and encouraging for future reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal studies by the use of hepatocyte cell lines in particle risk assessment.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and protein kinase cδ contribute to endothelin-1 constriction and elevated blood pressure in intermittent hypoxia. obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is associated with cardiovascular complications including hypertension. previous findings from our laboratory indicate that exposure to intermittent hypoxia (ih), to mimic sleep apnea, increases blood pressure in rats. ih also increases endothelin-1 (et-1) constrictor sensitivity in a protein kinase c (pkc) δ-dependent manner in mesenteric arteries. because phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1) regulates pkcδ activity, we hypothesized that pdk-1 contributes to the augmented et-1 constrictor sensitivity and elevated blood pressure following ih. male sprague-dawley rats were exposed to either sham or ih (cycles between 21% o(2)/0% co(2) and 5% o(2)/5% co(2)) conditions for 7 h/day for 14 or 21 days. the contribution of pkcδ and pdk-1 to et-1-mediated vasoconstriction was assessed in mesenteric arteries using pharmacological inhibitors. constrictor sensitivity to et-1 was enhanced in arteries from ih-exposed rats. inhibition of pkcδ or pdk-1 blunted et-1 constriction in arteries from ih but not sham group rats. western analysis revealed similar levels of total and phosphorylated pdk-1 in arteries from sham and ih group rats but decreased protein-protein interaction between pkcδ and pdk-1 in arteries from ih- compared with sham-exposed rats. blood pressure was increased in rats exposed to ih, and treatment with the pdk-1 inhibitor osu-03012 [2-amino-n-{4-[5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1h-pyrazol-1-yl]-phenyl}-acetamide] (33 mg/day) lowered blood pressure in ih but not sham group rats. our results suggest that exposure to ih unmasks a role for pdk-1 in regulating et-1 constrictor sensitivity and blood pressure that is not present under normal conditions. these novel findings suggest that pdk-1 may be a uniquely effective antihypertensive therapy for osa patients.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ intercellular adhesion molecule-2 is involved in apical ectoplasmic specialization dynamics during spermatogenesis in the rat. in this study, we investigated the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (icam2) in the testis. icam2 is a cell adhesion protein having important roles in cell migration, especially during inflammation when leukocytes cross the endothelium. herein, we showed icam2 to be expressed by germ and sertoli cells in the rat testis. when a monospecific antibody was used for immunolocalization experiments, icam2 was found to surround the heads of elongating/elongated spermatids in all stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. to determine whether icam2 is a constituent of apical ectoplasmic specialization (es), co-immunoprecipitation and dual immunofluorescence staining were performed. interestingly, icam2 was found to associate with β1-integrin, nectin-3, afadin, src, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, annexin ii, and actin. following cdcl₂ treatment, icam2 was found to be upregulated during restructuring of the seminiferous epithelium, with round spermatids becoming increasingly immunoreactive for icam2 by 6-16 h. interestingly, there was a loss in the binding of icam2 to actin during cdcl₂-induced germ cell loss, suggesting that a loss of icam2-actin interactions might have facilitated junction restructuring. taken collectively, these results illustrate that icam2 plays an important role in apical es dynamics during spermatogenesis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ estrogen receptor signaling as a target for novel breast cancer therapeutics. in breast cancer (bc) epithelial cells, the mitogenic action of estradiol is transduced through binding to two receptors, erα and erβ, which act as transcription factors. anti-estrogens (aes) and aromatase inhibitors (ais) are used clinically to arrest the estrogen-dependent growth of bc. in the case of ae or ai resistance, herceptin or lapatinib may be used to inhibit growth factors. estrogen effects are mediated not only through nuclear ers but also through cytoplasmic/membrane ers and g-protein-coupled ers. these estrogen-binding systems associate with various proteins that direct cell cycle signaling, proliferation and survival. the partners of nuclear er include src1-3, hdacs and erβ itself as well as newly identified proteins, such as e6-ap, lkb1, pelp1, pax-2 and foxa1. the partners of extra-nuclear erα include pi3k and the tyrosine kinase src. these various factors are all potential targets for therapeutic intervention. in addition, bc proliferation is enhanced by insulin and egf, which stimulate signaling through the mapk and pi3k/akt pathways by activation of the igf-1r and egfr axes, respectively. these pathways are tightly interconnected with er-activated signaling, and membrane erα forms complexes with src and pi3k. chemokine-mediated signaling also modulates the estrogen response. inhibiting these pathways with specific inhibitors or activating some of the pathways by gene manipulation may be therapeutically valuable for arresting bc cell cycle progression and for inducing apoptosis to antagonize hormone-resistance. here, we review some newly identified putatively targetable er partners and highlight the need to develop tumor-targeting drug carrier systems affecting both the tumor cells and the tumor environment.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ the s349t mutation of sqstm1 links keap1/nrf2 signalling to paget's disease of bone. mutations affecting the sequestosome 1 (sqstm1) gene commonly occur in patients with the skeletal disorder paget's disease of bone (pdb), a condition characterised by defective osteoclast differentiation and function. whilst most mutations cluster within the ubiquitin-associated (uba) domain of the sqstm1 protein, and are associated with dysregulated nfκb signalling, several non-uba domain mutations have also been identified. keap1 is a sqstm1-interacting protein that regulates the levels and activity of the nrf2 transcription factor. this in turn controls the expression of numerous cytoprotective genes that contribute to the cell's capacity to defend itself against chemical and oxidative stress, through binding to the antioxidant response element (are). the pdb-associated s349t mutation maps to the keap1-interacting region (kir) of sqstm1, however the effects of pdb mutant sqstm1 on keap1 function have not been investigated. here we show that unlike other sqstm1 mutations, the s349t mutation results in neither impaired ubiquitin-binding function in pull-down assays, nor dysregulated nfκb signalling in luciferase reporter assays. keap1 is expressed in differentiating osteoclast-like cells and the s349t mutation selectively impairs the sqstm1-keap1 interaction in co-immunoprecipitations, which molecular modelling indicates results from effects on critical hydrogen bonds required to stabilise the kir-keap1 complex. further, s349t mutant sqstm1, but not other pdb-associated mutants, showed reduced ability to activate nrf2 signalling as assessed by are-luciferase reporter assays. thus, sqstm1-mediated dysregulation of the keap1-nrf2 axis, which could potentially lead to aberrant production of oxidative response genes, may contribute to disease aetiology in a subset of pdb patients.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ expression of camp-responsive element binding proteins (crebs) in fast- and slow-twitch muscles: a signaling pathway to account for the synaptic expression of collagen-tailed subunit (colq) of acetylcholinesterase at the rat neuromuscular junction. the gene encoding the collagen-tailed subunit (colq) of acetylcholinesterase (ache) contains two distinct promoters that drive the production of two colq mrnas, colq-1 and colq-1a, in slow- and fast-twitch muscles, respectively. colq-1a is expressed at the neuromuscular junction (nmj) in fast-twitch muscle, and this expression depends on trophic factors supplied by motor neurons signaling via a camp-dependent pathway in muscle. to further elucidate the molecular basis of colq-1a's synaptic expression, here we investigated the expression and localization of camp-responsive element binding protein (creb) at the synaptic and extra-synaptic regions of fast- and slow-twitch muscles from adult rats. the total amount of active, phosphorylated creb (p-creb) present in slow-twitch soleus muscle was higher than that in fast-twitch tibialis muscle, but p-creb was predominantly expressed in the fast-twitch muscle at nmjs. in contrast, p-creb was detected in both synaptic and extra-synaptic regions of slow-twitch muscle. these results reveal, for the first time, the differential distribution of p-creb in fast- and slow-twitch muscles, which might support the crucial role of camp-dependent signaling in controlling the synapse-specific expression of colq-1a in fast-twitch muscles.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ analysis of mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (adh5): characterisation of rat adh5 with comparisons to the corresponding human variant. alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (adh5) is a member of the mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase family of yet undefined functions. adh5 was first identified at the dna level in human and deer mouse. a rat alcohol dehydrogenase structure of similar type has been isolated at the cdna level using human adh5 as a screening probe, where the rat cdna structure displayed several atypical properties. mrna for rat adh5 was found in multiple tissues, especially in the kidney. in vitro translation experiments indicated that rat adh5 is expressed as efficiently as adh1 and furthermore, rat adh5 was readily expressed in cos cells fused to green fluorescent protein. however, no soluble adh5 protein could be heterologously expressed in escherichia coli cells with expression systems successfully used for other mammalian adhs, including fused to glutathione-s-transferase. molecular modelling of the enzyme indicated that the protein does not fold in a productive way, which can be the explanation why no stable and active adh5 has been isolated. these results indicate that adh5, while readily expressed at the mrna level, does not behave similarly to other mammalian adhs investigated. the results, in vitro and in silico, suggest an unstable adh5 structure, which can explain for why no active and stable protein can be isolated. further possibilities are conceivable: the adh5 protein may have to interact with a stabiliser, or the gene is actually a pseudogene.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ catalpol inhibits lps plus ifn-γ-induced inflammatory response in astrocytes primary cultures. a large body of evidence suggests that the inflammatory reaction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. our previous studies described the neuroprotective effects of catalpol in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced inflammatory models, in which catalpol was shown to prevent mesencephalic neuron death and ameliorate cognitive ability animals. to further investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of catalpol, astrocytes were pretreated with low (0.1mm) and high dose (0.5mm) catalpol for 1h prior to lps plus interferon-γ stimulation. biochemical analyses showed that no and ros production and inos activity were significantly reduced by catalpol. data at transcriptional level also demonstrated that catalpol potently attenuated gene expressions involved in inflammation, such as inos, cox-2 and tlr4. in addition, our exploration further revealed that the suppressive action of catalpol on inflammation was mediated via inhibiting nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) activation. collectively, these results suggest that catalpol can exert inhibitory effects on the inflammatory reaction in astrocytes and that inactivation of nf-κb could be the major determinant for its anti-inflammatory mechanism. therefore, catalpol may potentially be a highly effective therapeutic agent in treating neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cardiolipin-dependent reconstitution of respiratory supercomplexes from purified saccharomyces cerevisiae complexes iii and iv. here, we report for the first time in vitro reconstitution of the respiratory supercomplexes from individual complexes iii and iv. complexes iii and iv were purified from saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria. complex iii contained eight molecules of cardiolipin, and complex iv contained two molecules of cardiolipin, as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. complex iv also contained rcf1p. no supercomplexes were formed upon mixing of the purified complexes, and low amounts of the supercomplex trimer iii(2)iv(1) were formed after reconstitution into proteoliposomes containing only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. further addition of cardiolipin to the proteoliposome reconstitution mixture resulted in distinct formation of both the iii(2)iv(1) supercomplex trimer and iii(2)iv(2) supercomplex tetramer. no other anionic phospholipid was as effective as cardiolipin in supporting tetramer formation. phospholipase treatment of complex iv prevented trimer formation in the absence of cardiolipin. both trimer and tetramer formations were restored by cardiolipin. analysis of the reconstituted tetramer by single particle electron microscopy confirmed native organization of individual complexes within the supercomplex. in conclusion, although some trimer formation occurred dependent only on tightly bound cardiolipin, tetramer formation required additional cardiolipin. this is consistent with the high cardiolipin content in the native tetramer. the dependence on cardiolipin for supercomplex formation suggests that changes in cardiolipin levels resulting from changes in physiological conditions may control the equilibrium between individual respiratory complexes and supercomplexes in vivo.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ steroid toxicity and detoxification in ascomycetous fungi. in the last couple of decades fungal infections have become a significant clinical problem. a major interest into fungal steroid action has been provoked since research has proven that steroid hormones are toxic to fungi and affect the host/fungus relationship. steroid hormones were found to differ in their antifungal activity in ascomycetous fungi hortaea werneckii, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus oryzae. dehydroepiandrosterone was shown to be the strongest inhibitor of growth in all three varieties of fungi followed by androstenedione and testosterone. for their protection, fungi use several mechanisms to lower the toxic effects of steroids. the efficiency of biotransformation in detoxification depended on the microorganism and steroid substrate used. biotransformation was a relatively slow process as it also depended on the growth phase of the fungus. in addition to biotransformation, steroid extrusion out of the cells contributed to the lowering of the active intracellular steroid concentration. plasma membrane pdr5 transporter was found to be the most effective, followed by snq2 transporter and vacuolar transporters ybt1 and ycf1. proteins aus1 and dan1 were not found to be involved in steroid import. the research of possible targets of steroid hormone action in fungi suggests that steroid hormones inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis in s. cerevisiae and h. werneckii. results of this inhibition caused changes in the sterol content of the cellular membrane. the presence of steroid hormones most probably causes the degradation of the tat2 permease and impairment of tryptophan import.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ arsenic suppresses cell survival via pirh2-mediated proteasomal degradation of δnp63 protein. transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family, shares a high degree of sequence similarity with p53. because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, tap63 and δnp63. although tap63 acts as a tumor suppressor, δnp63 functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. thus, therapeutic agents targeting δnp63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress δnp63. here we found that arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits δnp63 but not tap63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. in addition, we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of δnp63 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of δnp63 transcript. furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the pirh2 promoter and consequently induces pirh2 expression. consistent with this, we found that knockdown of pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of pirh2 enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of δnp63 protein. importantly, we found that knockdown of δnp63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of δnp63 inhibits, growth suppression induced by arsenic. together, these data suggest that arsenic degrades δnp63 protein at least in part via pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of δnp63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ electrical stimuli release atp to increase glut4 translocation and glucose uptake via pi3kγ-akt-as160 in skeletal muscle cells. skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to exercise is preserved in insulin-resistant conditions, but the signals involved are debated. atp is released from skeletal muscle by contractile activity and can autocrinely signal through purinergic receptors, and we hypothesized it may influence glucose uptake. electrical stimulation, atp, and insulin each increased fluorescent 2-nbd-glucose (2-nbdg) uptake in primary myotubes, but only electrical stimulation and atp-dependent 2-nbdg uptake were inhibited by adenosine-phosphate phosphatase and by purinergic receptor blockade (suramin). electrical stimulation transiently elevated extracellular atp and caused akt phosphorylation that was additive to insulin and inhibited by suramin. exogenous atp transiently activated akt and, inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) or akt as well as dominant-negative akt mutant, reduced atp-dependent 2-nbdg uptake and akt phosphorylation. atp-dependent 2-nbdg uptake was also inhibited by the g protein βγ subunit-interacting peptide βark-ct and by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-γ (pi3kγ) inhibitor as605240. atp caused translocation of glut4myc-egfp to the cell surface, mechanistically mediated by increased exocytosis involving as160/rab8a reduced by dominant-negative akt or pi3kγ kinase-dead mutants, and potentiated by myristoylated pi3kγ. atp stimulated 2-nbdg uptake in normal and insulin-resistant adult muscle fibers, resembling the reported effect of exercise. hence, the atp-induced pathway may be tapped to bypass insulin resistance.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ the cop9 signalosome interacts with and regulates interferon regulatory factor 5 protein stability. the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (irf5) exerts crucial functions in the regulation of host immunity against extracellular pathogens, dna damage-induced apoptosis, death receptor signaling, and macrophage polarization. tight regulation of irf5 is thus warranted for an efficient response toward extracellular stressors and for limiting autoimmune and inflammatory responses. here we report that the cop9 signalosome (csn), a general modulator of diverse cellular and developmental processes, associates constitutively with irf5 and promotes its protein stability. the constitutive csn/irf5 interaction was identified using proteomics and confirmed by endogenous immunoprecipitations. the csn/irf5 interaction occurred on the carboxyl and amino termini of irf5; a single internal deletion from amino acids 455 to 466 (δ455-466) was found to significantly reduce irf5 protein stability. csn subunit 3 (csn3) was identified as a direct interacting partner of irf5, and knockdown of this subunit with small interfering rnas resulted in enhanced degradation. degradation was further augmented by knockdown of csn1 and csn3 together. the ubiquitin e1 inhibitor ubei-41 or the proteasome inhibitor mg132 prevented irf5 degradation, supporting the idea that its stability is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. importantly, activation of irf5 by the death receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) resulted in enhanced degradation via loss of the csn/irf5 interaction. this study defines csn to be a new interacting partner of irf5 that controls its stability.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ new oral anticoagulants: comparative pharmacology with vitamin k antagonists. new oral anticoagulants (oacs) that directly inhibit factor xa (fxa) or thrombin have been developed for the long-term prevention of thromboembolic disorders. these novel agents provide numerous benefits over older vitamin k antagonists (vkas) due to major pharmacological differences. vkas are economical and very well characterized, but have important limitations that can outweigh these advantages, such as slow onset of action, narrow therapeutic window and unpredictable anticoagulant effect. vka-associated dietary precautions, monitoring and dosing adjustments to maintain international normalized ratio (inr) within therapeutic range, and bridging therapy, are inconvenient for patients, expensive, and may result in inappropriate use of vka therapy. this may lead to increased bleeding risk or reduced anticoagulation and increased risk of thrombotic events. the new oacs have rapid onset of action, low potential for food and drug interactions, and predictable anticoagulant effect that removes the need for routine monitoring. fxa inhibitors, e.g. rivaroxaban and apixaban, are potent, oral direct inhibitors of prothrombinase-bound, clot-associated or free fxa. both agents have a rapid onset of action, a wide therapeutic window, little or no interaction with food and other drugs, minimal inter-patient variability, and display similar pharmacokinetics in different patient populations. since both are substrates, co-administration of rivaroxaban and apixaban with strong cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 and permeability glycoprotein (p-gp) inhibitors and inducers can result in substantial changes in plasma concentrations due to altered clearance rates; consequently, their concomitant use is contraindicated and caution is required when used concomitantly with strong cyp3a4 and p-gp inducers. although parenteral oral direct thrombin inhibitors (dtis), such as argatroban and bivalirudin, have been on the market for years, dtis such as dabigatran are novel synthetic thrombin antagonists. dabigatran etexilate is a low-molecular-weight non-active pro-drug that is administered orally and converted rapidly to its active form, dabigatran--a potent, competitive and reversible dti. dabigatran has an advantage over the indirect thrombin inhibitors, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, in that it inhibits free and fibrin-bound thrombin. the reversible binding of dabigatran may provide safer and more predictable anticoagulant treatment than seen with irreversible, non-covalent thrombin inhibitors, e.g. hirudin. dabigatran shows a very low potential for drug-drug interactions. however, co-administration of dabigatran etexilate with other anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents can increase the bleeding risk. although the new agents are pharmacologically better than vkas--particularly in terms of fixed dosing, rapid onset of action, no inr monitoring and lower risk of drug interactions--there are some differences between them: the bioavailability of dabigatran is lower than rivaroxaban and apixaban, and so the dabigatran dosage required is higher; lower protein binding of dabigatran reduces the variability related to albuminaemia. the risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions also appears to differ between oacs: vkas > rivaroxaban > apixaban > dabigatran. the convenience of the new oacs has translated into improvements in efficacy and safety as shown in phase iii randomized trials. the new anticoagulants so far offer the greatest promise and opportunity for the replacement of vkas.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(eih) activates p38 mapk/nrf2/ho-1 pathways in raw264.7 cells and reduces inflammation in clp-induced septic mice. eih induced expression of ho-1 protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. eih significantly diminished ho-1 expression in sinrf2 rna-transfected cells. as expected, the inhibited expression of inos/no, cox-2/pge2, hmgb1 release by eih in lps-activated raw264.7 cells was significantly reversed by siho-1rna transfection. furthermore, eih not only inhibited nf-κb luciferase activity, phosphorylation of iκbα in lps-activated cells but also significantly suppressed expression of adhesion molecules (icam-1 and vcam-1) in tnf-α activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. the induction of ho-1 by eih was inhibited by sb203580 but not by sp600125, pd98059, nor ly294002. most importantly, administration of eih significantly reduced not only increase in blood hmgb1, alt, ast, bun, creatinine levels but also decrease macrophage infiltrate in the liver of septic mice, which were reversed by znppix, a ho-1 inhibitor. we concluded that eih has anti-inflammatory effect via the induction of p38 mapk-dependent ho-1 signaling pathway.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ cellular signaling crosstalk between multiple receptors for investigation of pathophysiology in multifactorial diseases--what is clinically-relevant crosstalk? recently, genomics and proteomics have been utilized as advanced tools for investigation of cellular signaling pathways and molecular interactions, and elucidated promiscuous networks composed of numerous interactions among pathways. however, some of these interactions are considered to be simply contributing to background 'noise' and others are as 'crosstalk' biologically-relevant to cellular physiology, leading to synergy effects more than additive responses in an entire organism. effort is now required to determine which interactions truly contribute to final physiological output. a receptor is the prime example of connectors among the networks. it functions, not simply as a signaling gateway, but also as an active trader by forming inter-receptor dimers. furthermore, various receptors can modulate the function of the other receptors by input to common intracellular signaling pathways, establishing functional crosstalk among networks. our findings by combined analyses of gene polymorphisms of two separate genes present evidences that such is the case with human body in a clinical setting: 1) an integrated effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and protease activated receptor-1 (par-1) on susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness (ahr), and 2) a crosstalk effect between muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (machrs) and β(2) adrenoceptor (β(2)ar) on bronchodilatory response to anticholinergic agents in patients with copd. these results indicate that these interactions are unlikely to be 'noise' but functionally-relevant 'crosstalk' in a human body. this review attempts to highlight the clinically-relevant 'crosstalk' paradigm in a human body which provides us a novel insight necessary to investigate pathophysiology in common multifactorial diseases and to develop new drugs.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ comparison of orientation and rotational motion of skeletal muscle cross-bridges containing phosphorylated and dephosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain. calcium binding to thin filaments is a major element controlling active force generation in striated muscles. recent evidence suggests that processes other than ca(2+) binding, such as phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (rlc) also controls contraction of vertebrate striated muscle (cooke, r. (2011) biophys. rev. 3, 33-45). electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) studies using nucleotide analog spin label probes showed that dephosphorylated myosin heads are highly ordered in the relaxed fibers and have very low atpase activity. this ordered structure of myosin cross-bridges disappears with the phosphorylation of rlc (stewart, m. (2010) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 107, 430-435). the slower atpase activity in the dephosporylated moiety has been defined as a new super-relaxed state (srx). it can be observed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers (hooijman, p., stewart, m. a., and cooke, r. (2011) biophys. j. 100, 1969-1976). given the importance of the finding that suggests a novel pathway of regulation of skeletal muscle, we aim to examine the effects of phosphorylation on cross-bridge orientation and rotational motion. we find that: (i) relaxed cross-bridges, but not active ones, are statistically better ordered in muscle where the rlc is dephosporylated compared with phosphorylated rlc; (ii) relaxed phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cross-bridges rotate equally slowly; and (iii) active phosphorylated cross-bridges rotate considerably faster than dephosphorylated ones during isometric contraction but the duty cycle remained the same, suggesting that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated muscles develop the same isometric tension at full ca(2+) saturation. a simple theory was developed to account for this fact.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ intercalation pathway in many-particle lifepo4 electrode revealed by nanoscale state-of-charge mapping. the intercalation pathway of lithium iron phosphate (lfp) in the positive electrode of a lithium-ion battery was probed at the ∼40 nm length scale using oxidation-state-sensitive x-ray microscopy. combined with morphological observations of the same exact locations using transmission electron microscopy, we quantified the local state-of-charge of approximately 450 individual lfp particles over nearly the entire thickness of the porous electrode. with the electrode charged to 50% state-of-charge in 0.5 h, we observed that the overwhelming majority of particles were either almost completely delithiated or lithiated. specifically, only ∼2% of individual particles were at an intermediate state-of-charge. from this small fraction of particles that were actively undergoing delithiation, we conclude that the time needed to charge a particle is ∼1/50 the time needed to charge the entire particle ensemble. surprisingly, we observed a very weak correlation between the sequence of delithiation and the particle size, contrary to the common expectation that smaller particles delithiate before larger ones. our quantitative results unambiguously confirm the mosaic (particle-by-particle) pathway of intercalation and suggest that the rate-limiting process of charging is initiating the phase transformation by, for example, a nucleation-like event. therefore, strategies for further enhancing the performance of lfp electrodes should not focus on increasing the phase-boundary velocity but on the rate of phase-transformation initiation.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ silica precipitation by synthetic minicollagens. oligomeric pro-hyp-gly- (pog-) peptides, wherein the collagenous triple helix is supported by c-terminal capping, exhibit silica precipitation properties (o, hyp = (2s,4r)hydroxyproline). as quantified by a molybdate assay, the length of the covalently tethered triple helix (number of pog units) determines the amount of amorphous silica obtained from silicic acid solution. although lacking charged side chains, the synthetic collagens precipitate large quantities of silicic acid resulting in micrometer-sized spheres of varying surface morphologies as analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. similar precipitation efficiencies on a fast time scale of less than 10 min were previously described only for biogenic diatom proteins and sponge collagen, respectively, which have a considerably higher structural complexity and limited accessibility. the minicollagens described here provide an unexpected alternative to the widely used precipitation conditions, which generally depend on (poly-)amines in phosphate buffer. collagen can form intimate connections with inorganic matter. hence, silica-enclosed collagens have promising perspectives as composite materials.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ zinc-dependent lysosomal enlargement in trpml1-deficient cells involves mtf-1 transcription factor and znt4 (slc30a4) transporter. zinc is critical for a multitude of cellular processes, including gene expression, secretion and enzymatic activities. cellular zinc is controlled by zinc-chelating proteins and by zinc transporters. the recent identification of zinc permeability of the lysosomal ion channel trpml1 (transient receptor potential mucolipin 1), and the evidence of abnormal zinc levels in cells deficient in trpml1, suggested a role for trpml1 in zinc transport. in the present study we provide new evidence for such a role and identify additional cellular components responsible for it. in agreement with the previously published data, an acute sirna (small interfering rna)-driven trpml1 kd (knockdown) leads to the build-up of large cytoplasmic vesicles positive for lysotracker™ and zinc staining, when cells are exposed to high concentrations of zinc. we now show that lysosomal enlargement and zinc build-up in trpml1-kd cells exposed to zinc are ameliorated by kd of the zinc-sensitive transcription factor mtf-1 (metal-regulatory-element-binding transcription factor-1) or the zinc transporter znt4. trpml1 kd is associated with a build-up of cytoplasmic zinc and with enhanced transcriptional response of mrna for mt2a (metallothionein 2a). trpml1 kd did not suppress lysosomal secretion, but it did delay zinc leak from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm. these results underscore a role for trpml1 in zinc metabolism. furthermore, they suggest that trpml1 works in concert with znt4 to regulate zinc translocation between the cytoplasm and lysosomes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ serum amyloid a upsurge precedes standard biomarkers of hepatotoxicity in ritodrine-injected mice. the tocolytic agent ritodrine acts on the β2-adrenoceptor and is an effective treatment option for preterm labor. however, several adverse effects of ritodrine therapy, including liver damage, have been noted. to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ritodrine-induced adverse effects, development of sensitive biomarkers of these adverse events is necessary. here, we report the development and analysis of an animal model of ritodrine-induced liver damage. female mice received daily ritodrine injections for 2 weeks; liver samples were then collected and subjected to dna microarray analysis. ritodrine significantly altered the expression of genes related to steroid and lipid metabolism, as well as the metabolism of ritodrine itself. importantly, expression of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid a (saa) significantly increased after ritodrine injection, with values indicating the largest fold-change. this large increase in blood saa levels serves as a more sensitive biomarker than conventional liver enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. the increase in saa expression is specific to ritodrine-induced liver damage, because saa expression was not induced by other hepatotoxic drugs such as acetaminophen, valproic acid, or metformin. our in vitro studies showed that cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (camp) accumulation was not a primary cause of the ritodrine-induced saa increase. instead, saa expression was enhanced by indirect phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (stat3) mediated by interleukin-6. therefore, our study provides a method for sensitive and early detection of hepatic injury, and may thus help preclude serious liver damage due to ritodrine use in preterm labor.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination. avibactam (formerly nxl104, ave1330a) is a synthetic non-β-lactam, β-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of ambler class a and c β-lactamases and some ambler class d enzymes. this review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry, mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. although not a β-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to β-lactamases. very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. the addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of β-lactamase enzyme(s). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold mic reduction). limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp.). the pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration of ceftazidime. the maximum plasma drug concentration (c(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. the mean volume of distribution and half-life of 22 l (~0.3 l/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus β-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative isolates. the safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has been reported in three phase i pharmacokinetic studies and two phase ii clinical studies. ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.in conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ß-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. the exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (esbl), klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) and/or ampc ß-lactamases. in addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus p. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented p. aeruginosa infections.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ increased human dermal microvascular endothelial cell survival induced by cysteamine. background: cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by intralysosomal cystine accumulation, treated with cysteamine. recently, new adverse effects of cysteamine were reported. skin biopsies showed microvascular proliferation (angioendotheliomatosis). to examine the mechanism of angioendotheliomatosis associated with cysteamine toxicity, we examined the effect of cysteamine on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hdmvec). methods: after cysteamine exposure (range 0-3.0 mm) during 24 h, cell viability was measured using water soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (wst-1) in both control hdmvec and fibroblasts. cell proliferation and apoptosis rate were measured in hdmvec by bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) incorporation and caspase 3 and caspase 7 activity, respectively. intracellular glutathione (gsh) was measured in hdmvec after cysteamine exposure of 0, 0.1 or 1.0 mm. medium and cysteamine were refreshed every 6 h to mimic the in vivo situation. next, cell viability in hdmvec was measured after 24 h of gsh exposure (range 0-10.0 mm). results: hdmvec viability and proliferation increased after cysteamine exposure 0.03-3.0 mm (p < 0.01) and 0.03-1.0 mm (p = 0.01) respectively; cell viability in fibroblasts was not affected by incubation with cysteamine. apoptosis remained unaffected by incubation with 0-1.0 mm cysteamine, 3.0 mm caused increased apoptosis. intracellular gsh was significantly increased after incubation with cysteamine 0.1 mm (p = 0.02) and 1.0 mm (p < 0.01). hdmvec viability increased after exposure to gsh 1.0-5.0 mm (p < 0.01). conclusion: cysteamine concentrations, similar to those described in plasma of cystinosis patients, stimulate hdmvec viability and proliferation and increase intracellular gsh content. we postulate that this mechanism might underlie angioendotheliomatosis induced by cysteamine.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ a high-confidence interaction map identifies sirt1 as a mediator of acetylation of usp22 and the saga coactivator complex. although many functions and targets have been attributed to the histone and protein deacetylase sirt1, a comprehensive analysis of sirt1 binding proteins yielding a high-confidence interaction map has not been established. using a comparative statistical analysis of binding partners, we have assembled a high-confidence sirt1 interactome. employing this method, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (usp22), a component of the deubiquitinating module (dubm) of the saga transcriptional coactivating complex, as a sirt1-interacting partner. we found that this interaction is highly specific, requires the znf-ubp domain of usp22, and is disrupted by the inactivating h363y mutation within sirt1. moreover, we show that usp22 is acetylated on multiple lysine residues and that alteration of a single lysine (k129) within the znf-ubp domain is sufficient to alter interaction of the dubm with the core saga complex. furthermore, usp22-mediated recruitment of sirt1 activity promotes the deacetylation of individual saga complex components. our results indicate an important role of sirt1-mediated deacetylation in regulating the formation of dubm subcomplexes within the larger saga complex.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ characterization of cytosolic glutathione peroxidase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase genes in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) and their modulation by in vitro selenium exposure. selenium (se) is an oligonutrient with both essential biological functions and recognized harmful effects. as the selenocysteine (secys) amino acid, selenium is integrated in several se-containing proteins (selenoproteins), many of which are fundamental for cell homeostasis. nevertheless, selenium may exert toxic effects at levels marginally above those required, mainly through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros). the selenium chemical speciation can strongly affect the bioavailability of this metal and its impact on metabolism, dictating the levels that can be beneficial or detrimental towards an organism. glutathione peroxidase (gpxs) is the largest and the most studied selenoprotein family. cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cgpx, gpx1) and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (phgpx, gpx4) are widely distributed throughout tissues, and play a pivotal role in regulating the oxidative status in the cell. in this study we have cloned gpx1 and gpx4 genes in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). the constitutive mrna expression of these gpx genes was examined in 18 trout tissues and their responsiveness to se availability was analysed using a rainbow trout liver cell line (rtl). an inorganic (sodium selenite, na2seo3) and organic (selenocysteine, cys-se-se-cys) selenocompound have been used as se sources. gpx1 activity was also tested to verify the impact of transcript changes on the enzymatic function of these molecules. to understand if the results obtained from the transcript expression analysis were due to se bioavailability or generation of ros, the cytoxicity of the two selenocompounds was tested by measuring the impact of se on cell membrane integrity. lastly, se availability was quantified by mass spectrophotometry to determine the amount of se in the cell culture media, the se background due to the foetal calf serum supplement and the contribution from the two selenocompounds used in the treatments. three isoforms of genes for both gpx1 (gpx1a, 1b1 and 1b2) and gpx4 (gpx4a1, a2 and b) have been identified. the discovery of a third gene encoding for gpx1 and gpx4 hints that salmonids may have the biggest selenoproteome amongst all vertebrates. transcripts of gpx4 genes were more highly expressed in most tissues examined in vivo (except blood, head kidney and spleen), whereas those of the gpx1 genes were more responsive to selenium exposure in vitro, especially to the organic form. interestingly, gpx1a was the most sensitive to selenium availability in non stressful conditions, whereas gpx1b1 and gpx1b2 were highly induced by exposure to selenium levels that had some toxic effects on the cells. although the different concentrations tested of the two selenocompounds modulate gpx1 transcript expression to various degrees, no significant change of gpx1 enzymatic activity was detectable. our results lead us to conclude that trout gpx1 transcripts expression level may represent a sensitive biomarker for selenium intake, helping to evaluate if selenium concentration and chemical speciation impact on cell homeostasis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ manganese-exposed developing rats display motor deficits and striatal oxidative stress that are reversed by trolox. while manganese (mn) is essential for proper central nervous system (cns) development, excessive mn exposure may lead to neurotoxicity. mn preferentially accumulates in the basal ganglia, and in adults it may cause parkinson's disease-like disorder. compared to adults, younger individuals accumulate greater mn levels in the cns and are more vulnerable to its toxicity. moreover, the mechanisms mediating developmental mn-induced neurotoxicity are not completely understood. the present study investigated the developmental neurotoxicity elicited by mn exposure (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg; i.p.) from postnatal day 8 to pn27 in rats. neurochemical analyses were carried out on pn29, with a particular focus on striatal alterations in intracellular signaling pathways (mapks, akt and darpp-32), oxidative stress generation and cell death. motor alterations were evaluated later in life at 3, 4 or 5 weeks of age. mn exposure (20 mg/kg) increased p38(mapk) and akt phosphorylation, but decreased darpp-32-thr-34 phosphorylation. mn (10 and 20 mg/kg) increased caspase activity and f(2)-isoprostane production (a biological marker of lipid peroxidation). paralleling the changes in striatal biochemical parameters, mn (20 mg/kg) also caused motor impairment, evidenced by increased falling latency in the rotarod test, decreased distance traveled and motor speed in the open-field test. notably, the antioxidant trolox™ reversed the mn (20 mg/kg)-dependent augmentation in p38(mapk) phosphorylation and reduced the mn (20 mg/kg)-induced caspase activity and f(2)-isoprostane production. trolox™ also reversed the mn-induced motor coordination deficits. these findings are the first to show that long-term exposure to mn during a critical period of neurodevelopment causes motor coordination dysfunction with parallel increment in oxidative stress markers, p38(mapk) phosphorylation and caspase activity in the striatum. moreover, we establish trolox™ as a potential neuroprotective agent given its efficacy in reversing the mn-induced neurodevelopmental effects.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ the propeptides of vegf-d determine heparin binding, receptor heterodimerization, and effects on tumor biology. vegf-d is an angiogenic and lymphangiogenic glycoprotein that can be proteolytically processed generating various forms differing in subunit composition due to the presence or absence of n- and c-terminal propeptides. these propeptides flank the central vegf homology domain, that contains the binding sites for vegf receptors (vegfrs), but their biological functions were unclear. characterization of propeptide function will be important to clarify which forms of vegf-d are biologically active and therefore clinically relevant. here we use vegf-d mutants deficient in either propeptide, and in the capacity to process the remaining propeptide, to monitor the functions of these domains. we report for the first time that vegf-d binds heparin, and that the c-terminal propeptide significantly enhances this interaction (removal of this propeptide from full-length vegf-d completely prevents heparin binding). we also show that removal of either the n- or c-terminal propeptide is required for vegf-d to drive formation of vegfr-2/vegfr-3 heterodimers which have recently been shown to positively regulate angiogenic sprouting. the mature form of vegf-d, lacking both propeptides, can also promote formation of these receptor heterodimers. in a mouse tumor model, removal of only the c-terminal propeptide from full-length vegf-d was sufficient to enhance angiogenesis and tumor growth. in contrast, removal of both propeptides is required for high rates of lymph node metastasis. the findings reported here show that the propeptides profoundly influence molecular interactions of vegf-d with vegf receptors, co-receptors, and heparin, and its effects on tumor biology.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ switchable elastin-like polypeptides that respond to chemical inducers of dimerization. elastin-like polypeptides (elps) are protein polymers that reversibly phase separate in response to increased temperature, pressure, concentration, ionic strength, and molecular weight. if it were possible to engineer their phase separation to respond to specific molecular substrates, elp fusion proteins might be engineered as biosensors, smart biomaterials, diagnostic imaging agents, and targeted therapies. what has been lacking is a strategy to design elps to respond to specific substrates. to address this deficiency, we report that elp fusion proteins phase separate in response to chemical inducers of dimerization (cid). the rationale is that elp phase separation depends on molecular weight, concentration, and local hydrophobicity; therefore, processes that affect these properties, including noncovalent dimerization, can be tuned to produce isothermal phase separation. to test this hypothesis, constructs were evaluated consisting of an immunophilin: human fk-506 binding protein 12 (fkbp) attached to an elp. under stoichiometric binding of a cid, the fusion protein homodimerizes and triggers phase separation. this dimerization is reversible upon saturation with excess cid or competitive binding of a small lipophilic macrolide to fkbp. by modulating the elp molecular weight, phase separation was tuned for isothermal response to cid at physiological ionic strength and temperature (37 °c). to interpret the relationship between transition temperature and equilibrium binding constants, an empirical mathematical model was employed. to the best of our knowledge, this report is the first demonstration of reversible elp switching in response to controlled dimerization. due to its simplicity, this strategy may be useful to design elp fusion proteins that respond to specific dimeric biological entities.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ benzoquinone reveals a cysteine-dependent desensitization mechanism of trpa1. the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (trpa1) nonselective cation channel has a conserved function as a noxious chemical sensor throughout much of metazoa. electrophilic chemicals activate both insect and vertebrate trpa1 via covalent modification of cysteine residues in the amino-terminal region. although naturally occurring electrophilic plant compounds, such as mustard oil and cinnamaldehyde, are trpa1 agonists, it is unknown whether arthropod-produced electrophiles activate mammalian trpa1. we characterized the effects of the electrophilic arthropod defensive compound para-benzoquinone (pbqn) on the human trpa1 channel. we used whole-cell recordings of human embryonic kidney cells heterologously expressing either wild-type trpa1 or trpa1 with three serine-substituted cysteines crucial for electrophile activation (c621s, c641s, c665s). we found that pbqn activates trpa1 starting at 10 nm and peaking at 300 nm; higher concentrations caused rapid activation followed by a fast decline. activation by pbqn required reactivity with cysteine residues, but ones that are distinct from those previously reported to be the key targets of electrophiles. the current reduction we found at higher pbqn concentrations was a cysteine-dependent desensitization of trpa1, and did not require prior activation. the cysteines required for desensitization are not accessible to all electrophiles as iodoacetamide and internally applied 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanesulfonate failed to cause desensitization (despite large activation). interestingly, following pbqn desensitization, wild-type trpa1 had dramatically reduced response to the nonelectrophile agonist carvacrol, whereas the triple cysteine mutant trpa1 retained its full response. our results suggest that modification of multiple cysteine residues by electrophilic compounds can generate both activation and desensitization of the trpa1 channel.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ inhibitory effects of in vivo oxidized high-density lipoproteins on platelet aggregation: evidence from patients with abetalipoproteinemia. there is evidence that high-density lipoproteins (hdls) may regulate platelet function, but disparate results exist regarding the effects of oxidized hdls on platelets. the objective of our study was to determine the role of in vivo oxidized hdls on platelet aggregation. platelet aggregation and redox status were investigated in 5 patients with abetalipoproteinemia (ablp) or homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia, two rare metabolic diseases characterized by the absence of apolipoprotein b-containing lipoproteins, compared to 5 control subjects. platelets isolated from plasma of patients with ablp aggregated 4 to 10 times more than control platelets, depending on the agonist. by contrast, no differences in the extent of platelet aggregation were observed between ablp platelet-rich plasma (prp) and control prp, suggesting the presence of a protective factor in ablp plasma. ablp hdls inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation by binding to sr-bi, while control hdls had no effect. on the other hand, lipoprotein-deficient plasma from patients with ablp did not inhibit platelet aggregation. severe oxidative stress was evidenced in patients with ablp. compared to control hdls, ablp hdls showed a 40% decrease of α-tocopherol and an 11-fold increased malondialdehyde concentration. these results demonstrate that in vivo oxidized hdls do not lose their antiaggregatory properties despite oxidation.-calzada, c., véricel, e., colas, r., guillot, n., el khoury, g., drai, j., sassolas, a., peretti, n., ponsin, g., lagarde, m., moulin, p. inhibitory effects of in vivo oxidized high-density lipoproteins on platelet aggregation: evidence from patients with abetalipoproteinemia.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ cardiac natriuretic peptide gene expression and plasma concentrations during the first 72 hours of life in piglets. plasma measurement of cardiac natriuretic peptides constitutes promising markers of congenital heart disease. however, concentrations change rapidly and dramatically during the first days after delivery even in healthy neonates, which complicates clinical interpretation. it is unknown whether these changes in plasma concentrations are explained by corresponding changes in the cardiac gene expression. we quantified the chamber-specific mrna levels of anp (a-type natriuretic peptide) and bnp (b-type natriuretic peptide) and plasma pro-anp and bnp-32 concentrations in healthy piglets during the first 72 hours of life (from 2 litters, n = 44). chamber-specific anp and bnp mrna levels reflected hemodynamic neonate changes at birth but did not correlate with circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations. however, plasma pro-anp and creatinine concentrations were closely correlated (p < .0001; r = 0.73). plasma pro-anp levels were highest on the day of delivery (5580 pmol/l [4320-6786] decreasing to 2484 pmol/l [1602-2898] after 72 hours, p < .0001). during the 72 hours, gel chromatography suggested that the translational products in circulation and in atrial tissue were immature, ie, unprocessed pro-anp. in contrast to pro-anp, bnp-32 plasma concentrations were low at delivery and peaked after 48 hours (12 [10.5-20.6] vs. 88.8 [71.7-101.4] pmol/l, p < .0001). to conclude, anp and bnp gene expression differs considerably between cardiac chambers in the first 72 hours of life in healthy piglets, resembling the transition from fetal to neonate circulation. however, the cardiac gene expression does not explain plasma concentrations.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ loss of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii activity in cortical astrocytes decreases glutamate uptake and induces neurotoxic release of atp. the extent of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) inactivation in the brain following ischemia correlates with the extent of damage. we have previously shown that a loss of camkii activity in neurons is detrimental to neuronal viability by inducing excitotoxic glutamate release. in the current study, we extend these findings to show that the ability of astrocytes to buffer extracellular glutamate is reduced when camkii is inhibited. furthermore, camkii inhibition in astrocytes is associated with the rapid onset of intracellular calcium oscillations. surprisingly, this rapid calcium influx is blocked by the n-type calcium channel antagonist, omega-conotoxin. while the function of n-type calcium channels within astrocytes is controversial, these voltage-gated calcium channels have been linked to calcium-dependent vesicular gliotransmitter release. when extracellular glutamate and atp levels are measured following camkii inhibition within our enriched astrocyte cultures, no alterations in glutamate levels are observed, whereas atp levels in the extracellular environment significantly increase. extracellular atp accumulation associated with camkii inhibition contributes both to calcium oscillations within astrocytes and ultimately cortical neuron toxicity. thus, a loss of camkii signaling within astrocytes dysregulates glutamate uptake and supports atp release, two processes that would compromise neuronal survival following ischemic/excitotoxic insults.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ 24(s)-hydroxycholesterol is actively eliminated from neuronal cells by abca1. high cholesterol turnover catalyzed by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase is essential for neural functions, especially learning. because 24(s)-hydroxycholesterol (24-ohc), produced by 24-hydroxylase, induces apoptosis of neuronal cells, it is vital to eliminate it rapidly from cells. here, using differentiated sh-sy5y neuron-like cells as a model, we examined whether 24-ohc is actively eliminated via transporters induced by its accumulation. the expression of abca1 and abcg1 was induced by 24-ohc, as well as to901317 and retinoic acid, which are ligands of the nuclear receptors lxr/rxr. when the expression of abca1 and abcg1 was induced, 24-ohc efflux was stimulated in the presence of high density lipoprotein (hdl), whereas apolipoprotein a-i was not an efficient acceptor. the efflux was suppressed by the addition of sirna against abca1, but not by abcg1 sirna. to confirm the role of each transporter, we analyzed hek293 cells stably expressing human abca1 or abcg1; we clearly observed 24-ohc efflux in the presence of hdl, whereas efflux in the presence of apolipoprotein a-i was marginal. furthermore, the treatment of primary cerebral neurons with lxr/rxr ligands suppressed the toxicity of 24-ohc. these results suggest that abca1 actively eliminates 24-ohc in the presence of hdl as a lipid acceptor and protects neuronal cells. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ pick1 deficiency impairs secretory vesicle biogenesis and leads to growth retardation and decreased glucose tolerance. secretory vesicles in endocrine cells store hormones such as growth hormone (gh) and insulin before their release into the bloodstream. the molecular mechanisms governing budding of immature secretory vesicles from the trans-golgi network (tgn) and their subsequent maturation remain unclear. here, we identify the lipid binding bar (bin/amphiphysin/rvs) domain protein pick1 (protein interacting with c kinase 1) as a key component early in the biogenesis of secretory vesicles in gh-producing cells. both pick1-deficient drosophila and mice displayed somatic growth retardation. growth retardation was rescued in flies by reintroducing pick1 in neurosecretory cells producing somatotropic peptides. pick1-deficient mice were characterized by decreased body weight and length, increased fat accumulation, impaired gh secretion, and decreased storage of gh in the pituitary. decreased gh storage was supported by electron microscopy showing prominent reduction in secretory vesicle number. evidence was also obtained for impaired insulin secretion associated with decreased glucose tolerance. pick1 localized in cells to immature secretory vesicles, and the pick1 bar domain was shown by live imaging to associate with vesicles budding from the tgn and to possess membrane-sculpting properties in vitro. in mouse pituitary, pick1 co-localized with the bar domain protein ica69, and pick1 deficiency abolished ica69 protein expression. in the drosophila brain, pick1 and ica69 co-immunoprecipitated and showed mutually dependent expression. finally, both in a drosophila model of type 2 diabetes and in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, we observed up-regulation of pick1 mrna expression. our findings suggest that pick1, together with ica69, is critical during budding of immature secretory vesicles from the tgn and thus for vesicular storage of gh and possibly other hormones. the data link two bar domain proteins to membrane remodeling processes in the secretory pathway of peptidergic endocrine cells and support an important role of pick1/ica69 in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ amelioration of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in c2c12 muscle cells by rooibos (aspalathus linearis). increased levels of free fatty acids (ffas), specifically saturated free fatty acids such as palmitate are associated with insulin resistance of muscle, fat and liver. skeletal muscle, responsible for up to 80% of the glucose disposal from the peripheral circulation, is particularly vulnerable to increased levels of saturated ffas. rooibos (aspalathus linearis) and its unique dihydrochalcone c-glucoside, aspalathin, shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic rats, could play a role in preventing or ameliorating the development of insulin resistance. this study aims to establish whether rooibos can ameliorate experimentally-induced insulin-resistance in c2c12 skeletal muscle cells. palmitate-induced insulin resistant c2c12 cells were treated with an aspalathin-enriched green (unfermented) rooibos extract (gre), previously shown for its blood glucose lowering effect in vitro and in vivo or an aqueous extract of fermented rooibos (fre). glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity were measured using 2-deoxy-[(3)h]-d-glucose, mtt and atp assays, respectively. expression of proteins relevant to glucose metabolism was analysed by western blot. gre contained higher levels of all compounds, except the enolic phenylpyruvic acid-2-o-glucoside and luteolin-7-o-glucoside. both rooibos extracts increased glucose uptake, mitochondrial activity and atp production. compared to fre, gre was more effective at increasing glucose uptake and atp production. at a mechanistic level both extracts down-regulated pkc θ activation, which is associated with palmitate-induced insulin resistance. furthermore, the extracts increased activation of key regulatory proteins (akt and ampk) involved in insulin-dependent and non-insulin regulated signalling pathways. protein levels of the glucose transporter (glut4) involved in glucose transport via these two pathways were also increased. this in vitro study therefore confirms that rooibos can ameliorate palmitate-induced insulin resistance in c2c12 skeletal muscle cells. inhibition of pkc θ activation and increased activation of ampk and akt offer a plausible mechanistic explanation for this ameliorative effect.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ puerarin stimulates proliferation and differentiation and protects against cell death in human osteoblastic mg-63 cells via er-dependent mek/erk and pi3k/akt activation. puerarin, the main isoflavone glycoside found in the chinese herb radix of pueraria lobata (willd.) ohwi, has received increasing attention because of its possible role in the prevention of osteoporosis. previously, we showed that puerarin could inhibit the bone absorption of osteoclasts and promote long bone growth in fetal mouse in vitro. further study confirmed that puerarin stimulated proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts in rat. however, the mechanisms underlying its actions on human bone cells have not been well defined. here we show that puerarin increases proliferation and differentiation and opposes cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human osteoblastic mg-63 cells containing two estrogen receptor (er) isoforms. puerarin promotes proliferation by altering cell cycle distribution whereas puerarin-mediated survival may be associated with up-regulation of bcl-xl expression. treatment with the er antagonist ici 182,780 abolishes the above actions of puerarin on osteoblast-derived cells. using small interfering double-stranded rna technology, we further demonstrate that the effects of puerarin on proliferation, differentiation and survival are mediated by both erα and erβ. moreover, we also demonstrate that puerarin functions at least partially through activation of mek/erk and pi3k/akt signaling. this agent also shows much weaker effect on breast epithelial cell growth than that of estrogen. therefore, puerarin will be a promising agent that prevents or retards osteoporosis.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ role of quercetin in cadmium-induced oxidative stress, neuronal damage, and apoptosis in rats. the present study was carried out to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of quercetin (qe) in protecting the cadmium (cd)-induced neuronal injury in frontal cortex of rats. a total of 30 adult male sprague-dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups of 10 animals each: control, cd treated and cd treated with qe. the cd-treated group was injected subcutaneously with cadmium chloride (cdcl2) dissolved in saline at a dose of 2 ml/kg/day for 30 days, resulting in a dosage of 1 mg/kg cd. the rats in qe-treated groups were given qe (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally starting 2 days prior to cd injection, during the study period. rats were sacrificed at the end of the study and the frontal cortex tissues were removed for biochemical and histopathological investigation. to date, there is no available information on the effect of qe on neuronal injury after cd exposure. rats intoxicated with cd for 30 days, significantly increased tissue malondialdehyde (mda) levels and significantly decreased enzymatic antioxidants superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase in the frontal cortex tissue. administration of qe with cd significantly diminished the levels of mda and significantly elevated the levels of enzymatic antioxidants in the frontal cortex tissue. the histopathological studies in the brain of rats also supported that qe markedly reduced the cd-induced histopathological changes and well preserved the normal histological architecture of the frontal cortex tissue. the caspase-3 immunopositivity was increased in degenerating neurons of the cd group. treatment with qe markedly reduced the immunoreactivity of degenerating neurons. in conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that qe may be beneficial in combating the cd-induced neurotoxicity in the brain of rats. we believe that further preclinical research into the utility of qe may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment for neurodegeneration after cd exposure in rats.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ oestrogen action on thyroid progenitor cells: relevant for the pathogenesis of thyroid nodules? benign and malignant thyroid nodules are more prevalent in females than in men. experimental data suggest that the proliferative effect of oestrogen rather than polymorphisms is responsible for this gender difference. this study analysed whether both differentiated thyroid cells and thyroid stem and progenitor cells are a target of oestrogen action. in thyroid stem/progenitor cells derived from nodular goitres the ability of 17beta-oestradiol to induce thyrosphere formation, the expression of oestrogen receptors and the effect of 17beta-oestradiol on growth, expression of marker of stem cells and thyroid differentiation (tsh receptor, thyroperoxidase, thyroglobulin, sodium iodide symporter expression) were analysed. 17beta-oestradiol induced thyrosphere formation, albeit to lower extent than other growth factors. thyroid stem and progenitor cells expressed oestrogen receptor alpha and beta with an 8 time higher expression level of oestrogen receptor alpha mrna compared to differentiated thyrocytes. 17beta-oestradiol was a potent stimulator of thyroid stem/ progenitor cell growth. in contrast, tsh-induced differentiation of progenitor cells, in particular the expression of the sodium iodide symporter, was significantly inhibited by 17beta-oestradiol.in conclusion, oestrogen stimulated growth and simultaneously inhibited differentiation of thyroid nodules derived stem/progenitor cells. from these data and based on the concept of cellular heterogeneity, we hypothesize a supportive role of oestrogen in the propagation of thyroid stem/progenitor cells leading to a selection of a progeny of growth-prone cells with a decreased differentiation. these cells may be the origin of hypo- or non-functioning thyroid nodules in females.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ differential regulation of arabidopsis plastid gene expression and rna editing in non-photosynthetic tissues. rna editing is one of the post-transcriptional processes that commonly occur in plant plastids and mitochondria. in arabidopsis, 34 c-to-u rna editing events, affecting transcripts of 18 plastid genes, have been identified. here, we examined the editing and expression of these transcripts in different organs, and in green and non-green seedlings (etiolated, cia5-2, ispf and ispg albino mutants, lincomycin-, and norflurazon-treated). the editing efficiency of arabidopsis plastid transcripts varies from site to site, and may be specifically regulated in different tissues. steady state levels of plastid transcripts are low or undetectable in etiolated seedlings, but most editing sites are edited with efficiencies similar to those observed in green seedlings. by contrast, the editing of some sites is completely lost or significantly reduced in other non-green tissues; for instance, the editing of ndhb-149, ndhb-1255, and ndhd-2 is completely lost in roots and in lincomycin-treated seedlings. the editing of ndhd-2 is also completely lost in albino mutants and norflurazon-treated seedlings. however, matk-640 is completely edited, and accd-794, atpf-92, psbe-214, psbf-77, psbz-50, and rps14-50 are completely or highly edited in both green and non-green tissues. in addition, the expression of nucleus-encoded rna polymerase dependent transcripts is specifically induced by lincomycin, and the splicing of ndhb transcripts is significantly reduced in the albino mutants and inhibitor-treated seedlings. our results indicate that plastid gene expression, and the splicing and editing of plastid transcripts are specifically and differentially regulated in various types of non-green tissues.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ drug-drug interactions between hmg-coa reductase inhibitors (statins) and antiviral protease inhibitors. the hmg-coa reductase inhibitors are a class of drugs also known as statins. these drugs are effective and widely prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. seven statins are currently available: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin. although these drugs are generally well tolerated, skeletal muscle abnormalities from myalgia to severe lethal rhabdomyolysis can occur. factors that increase statin concentrations such as drug-drug interactions can increase the risk of these adverse events. drug-drug interactions are dependent on statins' pharmacokinetic profile: simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized through cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a, while the metabolism of the other statins is independent of this cyp. all statins are substrate of organic anion transporter polypeptide 1b1, an uptake transporter expressed in hepatocyte membrane that may also explain some drug-drug interactions. many hiv-infected patients have dyslipidemia and comorbidities that may require statin treatment. hiv-protease inhibitors (hiv pis) are part of recommended antiretroviral treatment in combination with two reverse transcriptase inhibitors. all hiv pis except nelfinavir are coadministered with a low dose of ritonavir, a potent cyp3a inhibitor to improve their pharmacokinetic properties. cobicistat is a new potent cyp3a inhibitor that is combined with elvitegravir and will be combined with hiv-pis in the future. the hcv-pis boceprevir and telaprevir are both, to different extents, inhibitors of cyp3a. this review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and pis with emphasis on their metabolic pathways explaining clinically important drug-drug interactions. simvastatin and lovastatin metabolized through cyp3a have the highest potency for drug-drug interaction with potent cyp3a inhibitors such as ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted hiv-pi or the hepatitis c virus (hcv) pi, telaprevir or boceprevir, and therefore their coadministration is contraindicated. atorvastatin is also a cyp3a substrate, but less potent drug-drug interactions have been reported with cyp3a inhibitors. non-cyp3a-dependent statin concentrations are also affected although to a lesser extent when coadministered with hiv or hcv pis, mainly through interaction with oatp1b1, and treatment should start with the lowest available statin dose. effectiveness and occurrence of adverse effects should be monitored at regular time intervals.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

[3h]thymidine incorporation into dna and cell counts were used as measures of cell proliferation. the percentage of cells that stained for alkaline phosphatase was used as a measure of differentiation. dihydrotestosterone (dht) enhanced mouse osteoblastic cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner over a wide range of doses (10(-8) to 10(-11) molar), and was maximally active at 10(-9) m. dht also stimulated proliferation in human osteoblast cell cultures and in cultures of the human osteosarcoma cell line, te89. testosterone, fluoxymesterone (a synthetic androgenic steroid) and methenolone (an anabolic steroid) were also mitogenic in the mouse bone cell system. the mitogenic effect of dht on bone cells was inhibited by antiandrogens (hydroxyflutamide and cyproterone acetate) which compete for binding to the androgen receptor. in addition to effects on cell proliferation, dht increased the percentage of alkaline phosphatase (alp) positive cells in all three bone cell systems tested, and this effect was inhibited by antiandrogens. we conclude that androgens can stimulate human and murine osteoblastic cell proliferation in vitro, and induce expression of the osteoblast-line differentiation marker alp, presumably by an androgen receptor mediated mechanism.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ characteristics of the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin. to determine the factors that influence the interaction between phenoxybenzamine and calmodulin, the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin was determined by equilibrium dialysis under a variety of experimental conditions. this interaction was found to be similar in some respects to the interaction between phenothiazines and calmodulin. it was saturable, with between 1 and 2 mol of phenoxybenzamine bound to 1 mol of calmodulin. it was also dependent upon temperature, the presence of a divalent cation such as calcium, and on ph, showing maximum binding at ph 6.5 with little binding at ph values below 4.2 or above 8.0. the site at which phenoxybenzamine bound to calmodulin appears to be similar to that at which certain antipsychotic agents bind, since several of them, including penfluridol, pimozide and spiroperidol, prevented the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin. however, in contrast to the reversible binding of most phenothiazines to calmodulin, phenoxybenzamine bound to calmodulin irreversibly. the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin was fairly selective in that other alpha-adrenergic agents such as prazosin, yohimbine and clonidine failed to bind to calmodulin when examined under the same experimental conditions. in addition, phenoxybenzamine showed little or no calcium-dependent binding to the s-100 protein, bovine serum albumin or cytochrome c. the irreversible complex between phenoxybenzamine and calmodulin may be useful for inhibiting certain calmodulin-dependent reactions and for studying the various biological functions of calmodulin.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ adenosine receptors: development of selective agonists and antagonists. adenosine modulates a variety of physiological functions through interaction with a1 and a2 adenosine receptors, where agonists mediate inhibition and stimulation, respectively, of adenylate cyclase. in the cardiovascular system, a2 receptors mediate vasodilation and reduction in blood pressure, while a1 receptors mediate cardiac depression. the involvement of adenylate cyclase in these responses remains unresolved. adenosine analogs in particular the n6-substituted compounds are more potent at a1 receptors than at a2 receptors. the subregion of the adenosine receptor that interacts with the n6-substituent is different for a1 and a2 receptors, particularly with respect to phenyl interactions, bulk tolerance and stereoselectivity. a series of para-substituted n6-phenyladenosines have been synthesized based on a "functionalized congener" approach in which a chemically reactive group, such as an amine or carboxylic acid, is introduced at the terminus of a chain. from the "functionalized congener" are synthesized a variety of conjugates each containing a common pharmacophore. certain of the adenosine conjugates are highly selective for a1 receptors. xanthines are classical antagonists for adenosine receptors for many of their pharmacological actions may be due to blockade of adenosine receptors. caffeine and theophylline are virtually non-selective for a2 and a2 receptors. replacement of the methyl groups of theophylline with n-propyl or larger alkyl groups yields xanthines with selectivity for a1 receptors, particularly when combined with an 8-phenyl moiety. most 1,3-dialkyl-8-phenyl xanthines are very insoluble, but incorporation of polar aryl substituents, such as sulfo or carboxy to increase solubility, results in marked reduction in potency and selectivity. a new series of more hydrophilic 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthines has been synthesized using the "functionalized congener" approach. certain conjugates of 8-[4-(carboxymethyloxy)phenyl 1]1,3-dipropylxanthine display a1 selectivity in biochemical and cardiovascular models. certain analogs of caffeine in which the methyl group at the 1- or 7-position is replaced with a propargyl or propyl group display selectivity for a2 receptors. the profile of a series of adenosine analogs or of xanthine antagonists can be used to define the nature of adenosine receptors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ inactivation of prostaglandin h synthase and prostacyclin synthase by phenylbutazone. requirement for peroxidative metabolism. phenylbutazone (pb), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is an efficient reducing cofactor for the peroxidase activity of prostaglandin h synthase (phs). most reducing cofactors for the peroxidase protect phs and prostacyclin synthase from inactivation by hydroperoxides. pb, however, does not protect these enzymes, but rather augments their hydroperoxide-dependent inactivation. using ram seminal vesicle microsomes as a source of phs and prostacyclin synthase, we have examined the interaction of pb and exogenous hydroperoxides. chromatographic analysis of the metabolism of 14c-labeled arachidonic acid in this system revealed that pb-dependent inactivation of phs is markedly increased in the presence of 100 microm h2o2. this inactivation is a linear function of pb concentration between 10 and 250 microm, with a half-maximal effect in this range at about 100 microm pb. prostacyclin synthase is even more sensitive to inactivation by the combined pb and h2o2 treatment, with a corresponding half-maximal effect at pb concentrations near 25 microm. this pb- and h2o2-dependent inactivation is demonstrable whether pgh2 is generated in situ from arachidonic acid or is added exogenously, supporting a direct effect of the treatment on prostacyclin synthase. as pb undergoes peroxide-dependent co-oxygenation catalyzed by phs, we propose that it is an oxygenated derivative of pb, rather than the parent compound, which is responsible for the inactivation of phs and prostacyclin synthase. nafazatrom, a competitive inhibitor of pb co-oxygenation, blocks the effects of the pb and h2o2 treatment, supporting our proposal.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ penicillin-binding proteins and role of amdinocillin in causing bacterial cell death. the activity of penicillins against bacteria is in large part related to binding to specific receptor proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis. these proteins have been designated penicillin-binding proteins. they can be separated into distinct entities through the use of acrylamide gel electrophoresis and binding of radioactive 14c-labeled penicillin g. six major proteins have been defined in the enterobacteriaceae, penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 6. selection of mutants has shown that there are three essential proteins: penicillin-binding protein 1, which is divided into penicillin-binding protein 1bs, a peptidoglycan transpeptidase, and penicillin-binding protein 1a, which acts as a replacement for penicillin-binding protein 1bs. penicillin-binding protein 2 is a murein-elongation initiating enzyme and penicillin-binding protein 3 is a septal murein-synthesizing enzyme. penicillin-binding proteins 4, 5, and 6 are not essential for bacterial survival. binding of penicillins to penicillin-binding protein 1bs produces lysis, binding to penicillin-binding protein 2 produces round cells, and binding to penicillin-binding protein 3 produces long filaments. amdinocillin is a beta-amidino penicillanic acid derivative that binds specifically to penicillin-binding protein 2. the compound is more beta-lactamase stable than ampicillin and has no major delay in entry into the periplasmic space as do some penicillins. amdinocillin inhibits most of the enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of some indole-positive proteus species, but it does not inhibit gram-positive cocci or pseudomonas aeruginosa. amdinocillin produces spherical bacterial cells that eventually lyse. its activity in vitro is markedly affected by ionic content of media. this agent acts synergistically with many penicillins, such as ampicillin, carbenicillin, and the like, and with cephalosporins, cefazolin, cefamandole, or cefoxitin to inhibit gram-negative bacilli, probably on the basis of binding to different proteins needed for the production of the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. amdinocillin possesses a number of the essentials for effective antimicrobial activity and, by virtue of its enhancement of the activity of other beta-lactams, may prove to be a useful agent in the chemotherapy of certain infections.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ loss of alpha 2-macroglobulin and epidermal growth factor surface binding induced by phenothiazines and naphthalene sulfonamides. we have found that certain naphthalenesulfonamides [e.g., n-6(-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (w-7)] and phenothiazines [e.g., trifluoperazine (tfp)] induce a loss of cell-surface receptors for alpha 2-macroglobulin, and epidermal growth factor (egf) in fibroblasts. the loss of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptors is independent of receptor occupancy and is rapidly reversed upon removal of these agents from the culture medium. the extent of egf receptor loss is less than for alpha 2-macroglobulin, and the egf receptors do not reappear at the surface when w-7 is removed. receptor loss was measured as a change in the capacity for binding iodinated ligands; no change in affinity of binding was observed. this receptor loss could reflect inactivation of receptors or internalization. w-7 did not induce a loss of cell surface beta 2-microglobulin, a membrane protein which is excluded from coated pits and which is not internalized, indicating that the effect of w-7 was specific for membrane receptors and not a result of bulk depletion of plasma membrane. the loss of alpha 2-macroglobulin and egf receptors occurs at concentrations which do not cause an increase in the ph of endocytic vesicles or the cytoplasm, indicating that these agents act by a mechanism distinct from the effect of other weak bases. since both tfp and w-7 are potent inhibitors of calmodulin, we investigated the possibility that inhibition of calmodulin was responsible for the loss of receptors. three lines of evidence suggest that calmodulin inhibition is not responsible for the inhibition of binding and endocytosis: 1) promethazine, a phenothiazine that is a poor inhibitor of calmodulin, is nearly as effective as tfp at inhibiting endocytosis; calmidazolium, a potent inhibitor of several calmodulin functions, did not cause a loss of binding; 2) the microinjection of calmodulin into cells did not reverse the effects of w-7; using pressure microinjection, we introduced up to a 100-fold excess of calmodulin over native levels into individual gerbil fibroma cells; using rhodamine-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin, we saw that the w-7 induced inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis was the same in injected and uninjected cells; 3) we injected calcineurin, a calmodulin-binding protein, into cells (1-3 pg/cell) and observed no effect on the receptor-mediated endocytosis of rhodamine-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin. these data indicated that cell surface receptor numbers can be regulated by a cellular component that is not cytoplasmic calmodulin but that shares some drug sensitivities with calmodulin.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

(1993) anesthesiology 79, 774-780). we have investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory action of several anesthetics on the purified erythrocyte ca(2+)-atpase by employing fluorescence spectroscopy measurements that report changes in the environment of intrinsic tryptophans and of an extrinsic probe attached in the active site of the enzyme. we have shown that the observed inhibition of the ca(2+)-dependent activation of the enzyme correlates well with the elimination of the ca(2+)-induced conformation change that is important for the proper function of the enzyme. analysis of the anesthetics effects on the total tryptophan fluorescence indicates a significant effect on enzyme conformation. similar changes have been observed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase. we propose that volatile anesthetics inhibit ca(2+)-atpase by interacting with nonpolar sites in protein interior, in analogy to the binding demonstrated for myoglobin, hemoglobin, and adenylate kinase (schoenborn, b. p., and featherstone, r. m.

consider the abstract: $ histamine enhances the depolarizing afterpotential of immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus via h1-receptor activation. previous studies have demonstrated that histamine primarily excites unidentified neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus. we investigated the neuromodulatory effects of histamine on immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus using intracellular recording techniques from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explant. exogenous application of histamine (0.1-100 microm) to vasopressinergic neurons produced a small membrane depolarization accompanied by an increase of up to 100% in the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential that follows current-evoked trains of action potentials. the enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by histamine did not depend upon the depolarization. further, histamine enhanced the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential when blocking the afterhyperpolarizing potential with d-tubocurarine or apamin, and in the presence of tetrodotoxin and d-tubocurarine or apamin, indicating a postsynaptic action of histamine on the depolarizing afterpotential that is not simply a reflection of a decrease in the afterhyperpolarizing potential. these toxins also had no effect on the histamine-induced depolarization. the enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by histamine was mimicked by the histamine h1-receptor agonist 2-thiazolylethylamine and was reduced or blocked by the h1-receptor antagonist promethazine, but was not blocked or reduced in the presence of the histamine h2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine. in summary, these results show that the excitatory effect of histamine on immunohistochemically identified vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus is due in part to the h1-receptor-mediated enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential independent of any change in the afterhyperpolarizing potential or membrane potential.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ binding of thalidomide to alpha1-acid glycoprotein may be involved in its inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha production. in addition to its well known sedative and teratogenic effects, thalidomide also possesses potent immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities, being most effective against leprosy and chronic graft-versus-host disease. the immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide has been ascribed to the selective inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha from monocytes. the molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide remains unknown. to elucidate this mechanism, we synthesized an active photoaffinity label of thalidomide as a probe to identify the molecular target of the drug. using the probe, we specifically labeled a pair of proteins of 43-45 kda with high acidity from bovine thymus extract. purification of these proteins and partial peptide sequence determination revealed them to be alpha1-acid glycoprotein (agp). we show that the binding of thalidomide photoaffinity label to authentic human agp is competed with both thalidomide and the nonradioactive photoaffinity label at concentrations comparable to those required for inhibition of production of tumor necrosis factor alpha from human monocytes, suggesting that agp may be involved in the immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ striatal dopamine, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter in chronic cocaine users. depletion of striatal dopamine (da) has been hypothesized to explain some of the neurological and psychiatric complications of chronic use of cocaine, including increased risk for neuroleptic-precipitated movement disorders. we measured levels of da, as well as two da nerve terminal indices, namely, the da transporter (dat) and the vesicular monoamine transporter (vmat2) in autopsied brain of 12 chronic cocaine users. mean da levels were normal in the putamen, the motor component of the striatum; however 4 of the 12 subjects had da values below the lower limit of the control range. da concentrations were significantly reduced in the caudate head (head, -33%; tail, -39%) with a trend for reduction in nucleus accumbens (-27%). striatal dat protein (-25 to -46%) and vmat2 (-17 to -22%) were reduced, whereas dat determined by [3h]win 35,428 binding was normal. in conclusion, our data suggest that chronic cocaine use is associated with modestly reduced levels of striatal da and the da transporter in some subjects and that these changes might contribute to the neurological and psychiatric effects of the drug.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ activation of cytoprotective prostaglandin synthase-1 by minoxidil as a possible explanation for its hair growth-stimulating effect. data from the literature indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, or ibuprofen, induce hair loss in vivo. these nsaids are well-known inhibitors of both the cytoprotective isoform of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 (pghs-1) and of the inducible form (pghs-2). by immunohistochemical staining, we found that pghs-1 is the main isoform present in the dermal papilla from normal human hair follicle (either anagen or catagen), whereas pghs-2 was only faintly and exclusively expressed in anagen dermal papilla. thus, pghs-1 might be the primary target of the hair growth-inhibitory effects of nsaids. we thus speculated that activation of pghs-1 might be a mechanism by which minoxidil (2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxyde) stimulates hair growth in vivo. we demonstrate here that minoxidil is a potent activator of purified pghs-1 (ac50 = 80 microm), as assayed by oxygen consumption and pge2 production. this activation was also evidenced by increased pge2 production by balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts and by human dermal papilla fibroblasts in culture. our findings suggest that minoxidil and its derivatives may have a cytoprotective activity in vivo and that more potent second-generation hair growth-promoting drugs might be designed, based on this mechanism.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ clinical manifestations of genetic defects affecting gonadotrophins and their receptors. raised activity of the lh axis caused by activating mutations of lh receptor gene presents with precocious puberty in boys, analogous to the presentation of lh secreting pituitary adenomas (faggiano et al., 1983; ambrosi et al., 1990). lh "hyperactivity' in females appears to have no effect. hyperactivity of the fsh axis caused by activating mutations of the fsh receptor gene might parallel the presentation of fsh secreting pituitary adenomas with sertoli cell hypertrophy in men (heseltine et al., 1989) or reversible premature ovarian failure in women (moses et al., 1986; okuda et al., 1989). indeed the first such case to be described is a male who maintained testicular volume and fertility in the absence of gonadotrophins (gromoll et al., 1996). female precocious puberty may require hyperactivity of both gonadotrophin axes because of the "two-cell' arrangement required for ovarian oestrogen production. mutations of the gs alpha-subunit gene can mimic this situation in some women with the mccune-albright syndrome (malchoff et al., 1994). lack of lh activity caused by defects in the lh beta molecule causes infertility in men and that resulting from inactivating mutations of the lh receptor gene causes leydig cell agenesis in men while ovarian development in females is relatively normal. lack of fsh activity caused by defects in the fsh beta caused infertility in a female, and that caused by inactivating mutations of the fsh receptor gene causes ovarian dysgenesis in women but only variable depression of spermatogenesis in men. incidentally, this categorization of reproductive disorders may also be applied to the tsh axis. pituitary adenomas and activating mutations of the tsh receptor gene (parma et al., 1993) cause hyperthyroidism and tsh beta gene defects (hayashizaki et al., 1989) and inactivating mutations of the tsh receptor gene (sunthornthepvarakul et al., 1995) cause hypothyroidism. to complete the analogy with thyroid disorders, it is curious that despite structural similarities with the tsh receptor, neither lh nor fsh receptor autoantibodies have a prominent role in ovarian pathophysiology (moncayo et al., 1989; van weissenbruch et al., 1991; simoni et al., 1993). complete gonadotrophin resistance is likely to be very rare, however, so what are we likely to find in partial gonadotrophin resistance? might the "resistant ovary syndrome' come right in the end, with corresponding minor fsh receptor mutations? experience with insulin and androgen resistance syndromes suggests that such a scenario is unlikely. insulin receptor gene mutations are found in extreme type a insulin resistance but not in moderate forms of insulin resistance (o'rahilly et al., 1991). androgen receptor gene mutations are found in nearly all cases of complete androgen insensitivity but rarely in partial forms (patterson et al., 1994). mild resistance to hormone action is rarely detectable in relatives who are heterozygous for receptor mutations which are inherited in a recessive pattern. it seems unlikely therefore, that individuals heterozygous for inactivating receptor mutations will manifest symptoms of reproductive disorders and account for common conditions. thus, while mutation analysis provides new insights into the gender specific role of the gonadotrophins the cause of early gonadal failure in the majority of individuals remains a mystery.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ evolution of the aminoacyl-trna synthetase family and the organization of the drosophila glutamyl-prolyl-trna synthetase gene. intron/exon structure of the gene, control of expression of the two mrnas, selective advantage of the multienzyme complex. in drosophila, glutamyl-prolyl-trna synthetase is a multifunctional synthetase encoded by a unique gene and composed of three domains: the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains catalyze the aminoacylation of glutamic acid and proline trna species, respectively, and the central domain is made of 75 amino acids repeated six times amongst which 46 are highly conserved and constitute the repeated motifs [cerini, c., kerjan, p., astier, m., gratecos, d., mirande, m. & semeriva, m. (1991) embo j. 10, 4267-4277]. the intron/exon organization of the drosophila gene reveals the presence of six exons among which four are in the 5'-end encoding glutamic acid activity. only one exon encodes the repeated motifs. a comparison of introns positions, intron classes and intron/exon boundaries in the drosophila gene and in its human counterpart is compatible with the intron-early hypothesis presiding, at least in part, to the evolution of the synthetases. the full-length fly protein is encoded by a 6.1-kb mrna which is expressed throughout development. in addition, a shorter transcript encompasses the 3'-end of the cdna and it is especially abundant in 5-10-h embryos until the first larval stage. expression of these two mrnas seems to be controlled by two independent promoters. the 6.1-kb mrna promoter is probably localized in the 5'-end of the gene. the small mrna promoter resides in the 4th intron and evidence is provided that the mrna encodes only the domain corresponding to prolyl-trna synthetase and is functional in vivo. finally, transgenic flies have been established by using constructs corresponding to the three domains of the protein. overexpression of the repeated motifs leads to a sterility of the flies that suggests a role of these motifs in linking the multienzyme complex to an, as yet, unknown structure of the protein synthesis apparatus.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ analysis of nmda receptors in the human spinal cord. nmda receptors in postmortem human spinal cord were analyzed using [3h]mk-801 ligand binding and immunoblotting with nmda receptor subunit-specific antibodies. the average kd for [3h]mk-801 binding was 1.77 nm with a bmax of 0.103 pmol/mg. the ec50 for stimulation of -3h-mk-801 binding with l-glutamate was 0.34 microm. none of these parameters were affected by postmortem intervals up to 72 h. immunoblotting of native nmda receptors showed that nr1, nr2a, nr2c, and nr2d subunits could all be found in the human spinal cord of which nr1 was preferentially located to the dorsal half. immunoprecipitation of solubilized receptors revealed that nr1, nr2c, and nr2d subunits coprecipitated with the nr2a subunit, indicating that native human spinal cord nmda receptors are heteroligimeric receptors assembled by at least three different receptor subunits. these results provide a basis for the development of drugs selectively aimed at spinal cord nmda receptors for the future treatment of spinal cord disorders.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ monoamine transporter and sodium channel mechanisms in the rapid pressor response to cocaine. intravenous (i.v.) cocaine (0.03-3 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent, rapid, and brief increases in blood pressure (bp) in conscious rats pretreated with the dopamine receptor antagonist, sch 23390. monoamine uptake inhibitors structurally analogous to cocaine (cocaethylene, cft, betacit, cpt, (+)-cocaine, norcocaine, and benztropine) also produced this rapid pressor response, whereas structurally unrelated uptake inhibitors with diverse monoamine transporter selectivities (btcp, indatraline, gbr 12935, mazindol, nomifensine, and zimeldine) either did not produce a rapid pressor response or produced only a small pressor response. at nonconvulsant doses, the sodium channel blockers acetylprocainamide, dibucaine, dyclonine, prilocaine, proparacaine, quinidine, and tetracaine produced a small pressor response or no increase in bp. in rats implanted with telemetric devices, cocaine and its analog, cft, produced a biphasic pharmacological response that consisted of an initial brief and abrupt behavioral arousal associated with a rapid, large increase in bp followed by prolonged, parallel increases in bp and locomotor activity. pretreatment with sch 23390 prevented the prolonged but not the initial rapid and brief pressor and activity responses to both cocaine and cft administration. the present data suggest that the inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin transporter functions, either alone or in combination, does not mediate the rapid pressor response to cocaine. the sodium channel-blocking action of cocaine per se does not appear to be involved in the rapid pressor response to cocaine. finally, the present results confirm previous findings that dopaminergic mechanisms mediate the prolonged increases in bp and locomotor activity produced by cocaine.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ identification of cdnas encoding two human alpha class glutathione transferases (gsta3 and gsta4) and the heterologous expression of gsta4-4. the expressed sequence tag database has been searched for examples of previously undescribed human alpha class glutathione transferases. an incomplete transcript of the previously described gsta3 gene was identified in a cdna library derived from 8-9 week placenta. this indicates that the gsta3 gene is functional and is possibly under specific developmental regulation. a second cdna, termed gsta4, was identified in a brain cdna library. the encoded gsta4-4 enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli and was found to be immunologically distinct from gsta1-1 and to have high activity with alk-2-enals. although gsta4-4 appears to be functionally similar to the mouse gst5.7 and rat gst8-8 alpha class enzymes, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis suggest that gsta4-4 may be a member of a distinct alpha class subgroup.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ characterization of binding sites of a new neurotensin receptor antagonist, [3h]sr 142948a, in the rat brain. the present study describes the characterization of the binding properties and autoradiographic distribution of a new nonpeptide antagonist of neurotensin receptors, [3h]sr 142948a (2-[[5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(4-(n-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-n-methyl carbamoyl)-2-isopropylphenyl)-1h-pyrazole-3-carbonyl]-amino]-ad amantane-2-carboxylic acid, hydrochloride), in the rat brain. the binding of [3h]sr 142948a in brain membrane homogenates was specific, time-dependent, reversible and saturable. [3h]sr 142948a bound to an apparently homogeneous population of sites, with a kd of 3.5 nm and a bmax value of 508 fmol/mg of protein, which was 80% higher than that observed in saturation experiments with [3h]neurotensin. [3h]sr 142948a binding was inhibited by sr 142948a, the related nonpeptide receptor antagonist, sr 48692 (2-[[1-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1h-pyrazole -3-carbonyl]amino]-adamantane-2-carboxylic acid) and neurotensin. saturation and competition studies in the presence or absence of the histamine h1 receptor antagonist, levocabastine, revealed that [3h]sr 142948a bound with similar affinities to both the levocabastine-insensitive neurotensin nt1 receptors (20% of the total binding population) and the recently cloned levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin nt2 receptors (80% of the receptors) (kd = 6.8 and 4.8 nm, respectively). the regional distribution of [3h]sr 142948a binding in the rat brain closely matched the distribution of [125i]neurotensin binding. in conclusion, these findings indicate that [3h]sr 142948a is a new potent antagonist radioligand which recognizes with high affinity both neurotensin nt1 and nt2 receptors and represents thus an excellent tool to study neurotensin receptors in the rat brain.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ isoform-specific inhibition of l-type calcium channels by dihydropyridines is independent of isoform-specific gating properties. dihydropyridines (dhps) block l-type ca2+ channels more potently at depolarized membrane potentials, consistent with high affinity binding to the inactivated state. nisoldipine (a dhp antagonist) blocks the smooth muscle channel more potently than the cardiac one, a phenomenon observed not only in native channels but also in expressed channels. we examined whether this tissue specificity was attributable to differences of inactivation in the two channel types. we expressed cardiac or smooth muscle alpha1c subunits in combination with beta2a and alpha2/delta subunits in human embryonic kidney cells, and used 2 mm ca2+ as the permeant ion. this system thus reproduces the in vivo topology and charge carrier of the channels while facilitating comparison of the two alpha1c splice variants. both voltage-dependent and isoform-specific sensitivity of 10 nm nisoldipine inhibition of the channel were demonstrated, with the use of -100 mv as the holding potential for fully reprimed channels and -65 mv to populate the inactivated state. under drug-free conditions, we characterized fast inactivation (1-sec prepulses) and slow inactivation (3 min prepulses) in the two isoforms. inactivation parameters were not statistically different in the two channel isoforms; if anything, cardiac channels tended to inactivate more than the smooth muscle channels at relevant voltages. likewise, the voltage-dependent activation was identical in the two isoforms. we thus conclude that the more potent nisoldipine inhibition of smooth muscle versus cardiac l-type ca2+ channels is not attributable to differences in channel inactivation or activation. intrinsic, gating-independent dhp receptor binding affinity differences must be invoked to explain the isoform-specific sensitivity of the dhp block.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ increased cat3-mediated cationic amino acid transport functionally compensates in cat1 knockout cell lines. arginine transport is important for a number of biological processes in vertebrates, and its transport may be rate-limiting for the production of nitric oxide. the majority of l-arg transport is mediated by system y+, although several other carriers have been kinetically defined. system y+ cationic amino acid transport is mediated by proteins encoded by a family of genes, cat1, cat2, and cat3. high affinity l-arginine transport was investigated in embryonic fibroblast cells derived from cat1 knockout mice that lack functional cat1. both wild type and knockout cells transport arginine with comparable km and vmax. however, the apparent affinity for lysine transport was 2.4 times lower in cat1(-/-) cells when compared with wild type cells, a property characteristic of cat3-mediated transport. northern analysis-documented cat2 mrna increased 2-fold, whereas cat3 mrna levels increased 11-fold in cat1(-/-) relative to cat1(+/+) cells. the low affinity cat2a mrna was not detectably expressed in these cells. even though cat3 expression is normally limited to adult brain, there was a large increase in the amount of cat3 protein present at the plasma membrane of cat1(-/-) embryonic fibroblast cells. these results suggest that cat3 compensates for the loss of functional cat1 in cells derived from cat1 knockout mice and mediates the majority of high affinity arginine transport.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:

consider the abstract: $ beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of ifn-gamma, il-3, and gm-csf mrna accumulation in activated human t lymphocytes is solely mediated by the beta2-adrenoceptor subtype. cytokine gene expression in t lymphocytes is a strictly regulated process, involving both stimulatory and inhibitory signals. beta-adrenoceptor (betaar) agonists are widely used in the treatment of asthma and are able to induce an inhibitory signal on immunological responses after binding to their specific receptors. in this study, the characterization of betaar subtype(s) (beta1, beta2, and beta3) involved in the regulation of interleukin (il)-3, il-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) mrna accumulation was studied by using various betaar agonists and antagonists. concanavalin a (con a)-induced ifn-gamma, gm-csf, and il-3 mrnas are dose-dependently inhibited by the nonselective betaar agonist isoproterenol and by the selective beta2ar agonist fenoterol. il-4 mrna accumulation was not susceptible to betaar stimulation. the observed inhibition on ifn-gamma, gm-csf, and il-3 mrna was blocked by the selective beta2ar antagonist ici 118,551 (10(-6) m) and by timolol (10(-6) m), a nonselective antagonist. the selective beta1ar antagonist atenolol (0.3 x 10(-6) m) did not have any effect. secretion of gm-csf protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of isoproterenol followed a similar pattern as observed for gm-csf mrna. in addition, the betaar-mediated inhibition of ifn-gamma, gm-csf, and il-3 mrna accumulation and gm-csf protein secretion were related to the accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) levels. although beta3ar mrna was detectable in con a-activated t lymphocytes, we could not demonstrate a functional activity in the regulation of cytokine expression: the beta3ar agonist brl 37344 had no effect on the accumulation of the studied cytokine mrnas, and did not significantly affect cellular camp levels. these data demonstrate that beta-agonist-induced inhibition of ifn-gamma, gm-csf, and il-3 mrna accumulation is solely mediated by beta2-adrenoceptors.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ oxytocin receptor binding and uterotonic activity of carbetocin and its metabolites following enzymatic degradation. metabolites of the analogue 1-deamino-1-carba-2-tyrosine(o-methyl)-oxytocin (carbetocin) following incubation with a rat kidney homogenate were isolated and their pharmacodynamic properties investigated. apart from the parent compound two metabolites were identified namely desglynh2-carbetocin (carbetocin metabolite i) and desleuglynh2-carbetocin (carbetocin metabolite ii). both carbetocin, carbetocin metabolite i and carbetocin metabolite ii displayed binding affinities to the myometrial oxytocin receptor of a similar magnitude as oxytocin. carbetocin was found to have agonistic properties on isolated myometrial strips and it was found to exert this effect through generation of inositol phosphates, as is the case for oxytocin. however, maximal contractile effect of carbetocin was approximately 50% lower than that of oxytocin (2.70 +/- 0.12 g compared to 5.22 +/- 0.26 g) and ec50 was approximately ten times higher (48.0 +/- 8.20 nm compared to 5.62 +/- 1.22 nm). neither carbetocin metabolite i nor carbetocin metabolite ii were able to contract isolated myometrial tissue. all three compounds displayed antagonistic properties against oxytocin in vitro, with carbetocin being the strongest inhibitor (pa2 = 8.21) and carbetocin metabolite ii (pa2 = 8.01) being stronger than carbetocin metabolite i (pa2 = 7.81). these results indicate that carbetocin is a partial agonist/antagonist to the oxytocin receptor while the two metabolites carbetocin metabolite i and carbetocin metabolite ii are pure antagonists. all three analogues bound to the myometrial vasopressin v1 receptor, albeit with much lower affinities than to the oxytocin receptor. carbetocin metabolite ii showed the weakest binding affinity of 33.7 +/- 7.34 nm compared to 7.24 +/- 0.29 nm for carbetocin and 9.89 + 2.80 nm for carbetocin metabolite i. only carbetocin bound to the renal vasopressin v2 receptor though the binding affinity was very low (61.3 +/- 14.6 nm).$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ crystallographic analysis of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase catalytic domain with bound catechol inhibitors at 2.0 a resolution. the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases represent a superfamily of structurally and functionally closely related enzymes, one of those functions being reversible inhibition by catechol derivatives. here we present the crystal structure of the dimeric catalytic domain (residues 117-424) of human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hpheoh), cocrystallized with various potent and well-known catechol inhibitors and refined at a resolution of 2.0 a. the catechols bind by bidentate coordination to each iron in both subunits of the dimer through the catechol hydroxyl groups, forming a blue-green colored ligand-to-metal charge-transfer complex. in addition, glu330 and tyr325 are identified as determinant residues in the recognition of the inhibitors. in particular, the interaction with glu330 conforms to the structural explanation for the ph dependence of catecholamine binding to pheoh, with a pka value of 5.1 (20 degreesc). the overall structure of the catechol-bound enzyme is very similar to that of the uncomplexed enzyme (rms difference of 0.2 a for the calpha atoms). most striking is the replacement of two iron-bound water molecules with catechol hydroxyl groups. this change is consistent with a change in the ligand field symmetry of the high-spin (s = 5/2) fe(iii) from a rhombic to a nearly axial ligand field symmetry as seen upon noradrenaline binding using epr spectroscopy [martinez, a., andersson, k. k., haavik, j., and flatmark, t. (1991) eur. j. biochem. 198, 675-682]. crystallographic comparison with the structurally related rat tyrosine hydroxylase binary complex with the oxidized cofactor 7,8-dihydrobiopterin revealed overlapping binding sites for the catechols and the cofactor, compatible with a competitive type of inhibition of the catechols versus bh4. the comparison demonstrates some structural differences at the active site as the potential basis for the different substrate specificity of the two enzymes.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ various glucocorticoids differ in their ability to induce gene expression, apoptosis and to repress nf-kappab-dependent transcription. glucocorticoids (gcs) influence a great variety of cellular functions by at least three important modes of action: the activation (or repression) of genes controlled by binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor (gr), the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes and the recently discovered cross-talk to other transcription factors such as nf-kappab. in this study we systematically compared various natural and synthetic steroid hormones frequently used as therapeutic agents on their ability to mediate these three modes of action. betamethasone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone and clobetasol turned out to be the best inducers of gene expression and apoptosis. all gcs including the antagonistic compound ru486 efficiently reduced nf-kappab-mediated transactivation to comparable extents, suggesting that ligand-induced nuclear localization of the gr is sufficient for transrepression. glucocorticoid treatment of cells did not result in elevated ikappab-alpha expression, but impaired the tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha-induced degradation of ikappab-alpha without affecting dna binding of nf-kappab. the structural requirements for the various functions of glucocorticoids are discussed.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
consider the abstract: $ cooperative binding of atp and mgadp in the sulfonylurea receptor is modulated by glibenclamide. the atp-sensitive potassium (katp) channels in pancreatic beta cells are critical in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of katp channels by atp, mgadp, and pharmacological agents, the molecular mechanism of katp-channel regulation remains unclear. the katp channel is a heterooligomeric complex of sur1 subunits of the atp-binding-cassette superfamily with two nucleotide-binding folds (nbf1 and nbf2) and the pore-forming kir6.2 subunits. here, we report that mgatp and mgadp, but not the mg salt of gamma-thio-atp, stabilize the binding of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32p]atp to sur1. mutation in the walker a and b motifs of nbf2 of sur1 abolished this stabilizing effect of mgadp. these results suggest that sur1 binds 8-azido-atp strongly at nbf1 and that mgadp, either by direct binding to nbf2 or by hydrolysis of bound mgatp at nbf2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-atp binding at nbf1. the sulfonylurea glibenclamide caused release of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32p]atp from sur1 in the presence of mgadp or mgatp in a concentration-dependent manner. this direct biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in nucleotide binding of the two nbfs of sur1 suggests that glibenclamide both blocks this cooperative binding of atp and mgadp and, in cooperation with the mgadp bound at nbf2, causes atp to be released from nbf1.$ from the given abstract, all the chemical and gene entities and relations between them are:
