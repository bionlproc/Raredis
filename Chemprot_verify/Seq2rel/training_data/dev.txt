in situ forming reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels for facile loading and triggered intracellular release of proteins. in situ forming reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels were designed and developed based on poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-(hydroxyethyl) methacrylate-co-acryloyl carbonate) (peg-p(hema-co-ac)) block copolymers for efficient loading as well as triggered intracellular release of proteins. peg-p(hema-co-ac) copolymers were prepared with controlled mn of 9.1, 9.5, and 9.9 kg/mol and varying numbers of ac units per molecule of 7, 9 and 11, respectively (denoted as copolymer 1, 2, and 3) by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization. these copolymers were freely soluble in phosphate buffer but formed disulfide-cross-linked nanogels with defined sizes ranging from 72.5 to 124.1 nm in the presence of cystamine via ring-opening reaction with cyclic carbonate groups. the sizes of nanogels decreased with increasing ac units as a result of increased cross-linking density. dynamic light scattering studies showed that these nanogels though stable at physiological conditions were rapidly dissociated in response to 10 mm dithiothreitol (dtt). interestingly, fitc-labeled cytochrome c (fitc-cc) could be readily loaded into nanogels with remarkable loading efficiencies (up to 98.2%) and loading contents (up to 48.2 wt.%). the in vitro release studies showed that release of fitc-cc was minimal under physiological conditions but significantly enhanced under reductive conditions in the presence of 10 mm dtt with about 96.8% of fitc-cc released in 22 h from nanogel 1. in contrast, protein release from 1,4-butanediamine cross-linked nanogels (reduction-insensitive control) remained low under otherwise the same conditions. mtt assays showed that these nanogels were nontoxic to hela cells up to a tested concentration of 2 mg/ml. confocal microscopy results showed that nanogel 1 delivered and released fitc-cc into the perinuclei region of hela cells following 8 h incubation. cc-loaded reductively degradable nanogels demonstrated apparently better apoptotic activity than free cc as well as reduction-insensitive controls. these in situ forming, surfactant and oil-free, and reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels are highly promising for targeted protein therapy.	@norel@
a case of therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia with t(16;21)(q24;q22) after chemotherapy with dna-topoisomerase ii inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and the alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide. a 59-year-old female suffering from malignant lymphoma developed therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia (t-aml) after chemotherapy consisting of treatment with dna-topoisomerase ii inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide. the cumulative dose of etoposide administration was 5500 mg; 1500 mg given intravenously and 4000 mg orally. one year later, she suddenly developed aml of fab m2. cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells revealed deletion of 7q and a rare translocation, t(16;21)(q24;q22). southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells did not detect rearrangement of the aml1 gene, however, fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis of bone marrow cells at interphase and metaphase revealed a translocational splitting between chromosome 21 involving aml1 gene and chromosome 16. these results suggest that the breakpoint is not located in the breakpoint cluster region for t(8;21). the patient was treated with chemotherapy and entered complete remission.	etoposide @chemical@ dna-topoisomerase ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ mitoxantrone @chemical@ dna-topoisomerase ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ etoposide @chemical@ dna-topoisomerase ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ mitoxantrone @chemical@ dna-topoisomerase ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
crystal structure of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent serine dehydratase from human liver. l-serine dehydratase (sdh), a member of the beta-family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent (plp) enzymes, catalyzes the deamination of l-serine and l-threonine to yield pyruvate or 2-oxobutyrate. the crystal structure of l-serine dehydratase from human liver (hsdh) has been solved at 2.5 a-resolution by molecular replacement. the structure is a homodimer and reveals a fold typical for beta-family plp-dependent enzymes. each monomer serves as an active unit and is subdivided into two distinct domains: a small domain and a plp-binding domain that covalently anchors the cofactor. both domains show the typical open alpha/beta architecture of plp enzymes. comparison with the rsdh-(plp-oms) holo-enzyme reveals a large structural difference in active sites caused by the artifical o-methylserine. furthermore, the activity of hsdh-plp was assayed and it proved to show catalytic activity. that suggests that the structure of hsdh-plp is the first structure of the active natural holo-sdh.	pyruvate @chemical@ l-serine dehydratase @gene@ @cpr:9@ pyruvate @chemical@ sdh @gene@ @cpr:9@ 2-oxobutyrate @chemical@ l-serine dehydratase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 2-oxobutyrate @chemical@ sdh @gene@ @cpr:9@ l-serine @chemical@ l-serine dehydratase @gene@ @cpr:9@ l-serine @chemical@ sdh @gene@ @cpr:9@ l-threonine @chemical@ l-serine dehydratase @gene@ @cpr:9@ l-threonine @chemical@ sdh @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
statins increase p21 through inhibition of histone deacetylase activity and release of promoter-associated hdac1/2. statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors broadly used for the control of hypercholesterolemia. recently, they are reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. in this study, we show that statins inhibited the histone deacetylase (hdac) activity and increased the accumulation of acetylated histone-h3 and the expression of p21(waf/cip) in human cancer cells. computational modeling showed the direct interaction of the carboxylic acid moiety of statins with the catalytic site of hdac2. in the subsequent enzymatic assay, it was shown that lovastatin inhibited hdac2 activity competitively with a k(i) value of 31.6 micromol/l. sp1 but not p53 sites were found to be the statins-responsive element shown by p21 luciferase-promoter assays. dna affinity protein binding assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the dissociation of hdac1/2 and association of cbp, leading to the histone-h3 acetylation on the sp1 sites of p21 promoter. in vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth were both inhibited by statins. these results suggest a novel mechanism for statins through abrogation of the hdac activity and promoter histone-h3 acetylation to regulate p21 expression. therefore, statins might serve as novel hdac inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.	statins @chemical@ p21 @gene@ @cpr:3@ statins @chemical@ hdac1/2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ statins @chemical@ 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase @gene@ @cpr:4@ lovastatin @chemical@ hdac2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ statins @chemical@ histone deacetylase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
impaired cliff avoidance reaction in dopamine transporter knockout mice. rationale: impulsivity is a key feature of disorders that include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). the cliff avoidance reaction (car) assesses maladaptive impulsive rodent behavior. dopamine transporter knockout (dat-ko) mice display features of adhd and are candidates in which to test other impulsive phenotypes. objectives: impulsivity of dat-ko mice was assessed in the car paradigm. for comparison, attentional deficits were also assessed in prepulse inhibition (ppi) in which dat-ko mice have been shown to exhibit impaired sensorimotor gating. results: dat-ko mice exhibited a profound car impairment compared to wild-type (wt) mice. as expected, dat-ko mice showed ppi deficits compared to wt mice. furthermore, the dat-ko mice with the most impaired car exhibited the most severe ppi deficits. treatment with methylphenidate or nisoxetine ameliorated car impairments in dat-ko mice. conclusion: these results suggest that dat-ko mice exhibit impulsive car behavior that correlates with their ppi deficits. blockade of monoamine transporters, especially the norepinephrine transporter (net) in the prefrontal cortex (pfc), may contribute to pharmacological improvement of impulsivity in these mice.	@norel@
5-hydroxytryptamine evokes endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures. activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) results in the production of nitric oxide (no) that mediates the vasorelaxing properties of endothelial cells. the goal of this project was to address the possibility that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) stimulates enos activity in bovine aortic endothelial cell (baec) cultures. here, we tested the hypothesis that 5-ht receptors mediate enos activation by measuring agonist-stimulated [3h]l-citrulline ([3h]l-cit) formation in baec cultures. we found that 5-ht stimulated the conversion of [3h]l-arginine ([3h]l-arg) to [3h]l-cit, indicating enos activation. the high affinity 5-ht1b receptor agonist, 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-not)-stimulated [3h]l-cit turnover responses were concentration-(0.01 nm to 100 microm) and time-dependent. maximal responses were observed within 10 min following agonist exposures. these responses were effectively blocked by the 5-ht1b receptor antagonist, isamoltane, the 5-ht1b/5-ht2 receptor antagonist, methiothepin, and the enos selective antagonists (0.01-10 microm): l-nomega -monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma) and l-n omega-iminoethyl-l-ornithine (l-nio). pretreatment of baec cultures with pertussis toxin (ptx; 1-100 ng/ml) for 16 hr resulted in significant inhibition of the agonist-stimulated enos activity, indicating the involvement of gi proteins. these findings lend evidence of a 5-ht1b receptor/enos pathway, accounting in part for the activation of enos by 5-ht. further investigation is needed to determine the role of other vascular 5-ht receptors in the stimulation of enos activity.	5-ht @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:3@ 5-hydroxytryptamine @chemical@ endothelial nitric oxide synthase @gene@ @cpr:3@ 5-ht @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:3@ 5-nonyloxytryptamine @chemical@ 5-ht1b @gene@ @cpr:5@ l-nomega -monomethyl-l-arginine @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:6@ methiothepin @chemical@ 5-ht1b @gene@ @cpr:6@ methiothepin @chemical@ 5-ht2 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ l-nmma @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:6@ l-n omega-iminoethyl-l-ornithine @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:6@ l-nio @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:6@ [3h]l-citrulline @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:9@ [3h]l-cit @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:9@ [3h]l-cit @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:9@ nitric oxide @chemical@ endothelial nitric oxide synthase @gene@ @cpr:9@ nitric oxide @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:9@ no @chemical@ endothelial nitric oxide synthase @gene@ @cpr:9@ no @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:9@ [3h]l-arginine @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:9@ [3h]l-arg @chemical@ enos @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
comparison of the effect of rofecoxib (a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor), ibuprofen, and placebo on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with osteoarthritis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. the rofecoxib osteoarthritis endoscopy multinational study group. objective: this randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that rofecoxib, a drug that specifically inhibits cyclooxygenase 2, would cause fewer gastroduodenal ulcers than ibuprofen (in a multicenter trial), and its side effects would be equivalent to those of placebo (in a prespecified analysis combining the results with another trial of identical design). methods: seven hundred seventy-five patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive rofecoxib at a dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg once daily, ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily, or placebo. gastroduodenal ulceration was assessed by endoscopy at 6, 12, and (for active treatment) 24 weeks. the primary and secondary end points were the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. results: ulcers were significantly less common (p < 0.001) following treatment with rofecoxib (25 mg or 50 mg) than with ibuprofen after 12 weeks (5.3% and 8.8% versus 29.2%, respectively) or 24 weeks (9.9% and 12.4% versus 46.8%, respectively). in the combined analysis, the 12-week ulcer incidence with 25 mg rofecoxib (4.7%) and with placebo (7.3%) satisfied prespecified criteria for equivalence. conclusion: at 2-4 times the therapeutically effective dose, rofecoxib caused fewer endoscopically detected ulcers than did ibuprofen. rofecoxib at a dose of 25 mg (the highest dose recommended for osteoarthritis) satisfied prespecified criteria for equivalence to placebo.	rofecoxib @chemical@ cyclooxygenase 2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ rofecoxib @chemical@ cyclooxygenase 2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase are involved in the mitochondrial synthesis and export of acylcarnitines. acylcarnitines are commonly used in the diagnosis of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation disorders (mfaods). it is generally assumed that this plasma acylcarnitine profile reflects the mitochondrial accumulation of acyl-coas. the identity of the enzymes and the mitochondrial and plasmalemmal transporters involved in the synthesis and export of these metabolites have remained undefined. we used lentiviral shrna to knock down the expression of medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase (mcad) in control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (cpt2)-, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (cact)-, and plasmalemmal carnitine transporter (octn2)-deficient human fibroblasts. these cell lines, including mock-transduced controls, were loaded with decanoic acid and carnitine, followed by the measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium. in control fibroblasts, mcad knockdown markedly increased the production of octanoylcarnitine (3-fold, p<0.01). octn2-deficient cell lines also showed extracellular accumulation of octanoylcarnitine (2.8-fold, p<0.01), suggesting that the cellular export of acylcarnitines does not depend on octn2. in contrast, in cpt2- and cact-deficient cells, the accumulation of octanoylcarnitine in the medium did not significantly increase in the mcad knockdown. similar results were obtained using pharmacological inhibition of cpt2 in fibroblasts from mcad-deficient individuals. this shows that cpt2 and cact are crucial for mitochondrial acylcarnitine formation and export to the extracellular fluids in mfaod.-violante, s., ijlst, l., te brinke, h., tavares de almeida, i., wanders, r. j. a., ventura, f. v., houten, s. m. carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase are involved in the mitochondrial synthesis and export of acylcarnitines.	acylcarnitines @chemical@ carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ acylcarnitines @chemical@ carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase @gene@ @cpr:9@ acylcarnitines @chemical@ carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ acylcarnitines @chemical@ carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase @gene@ @cpr:9@ acylcarnitine @chemical@ cpt2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ acylcarnitine @chemical@ cact @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
dopamine d1 receptor agonist and d2 receptor antagonist effects of the natural product (-)-stepholidine: molecular modeling and dynamics simulations. (-)-stepholidine (spd), an active ingredient of the chinese herb stephania, is the first compound found to have dual function as a dopamine receptor d1 agonist and d2 antagonist. insights into dynamical behaviors of d1 and d2 receptors and their interaction modes with spd are crucial in understanding the structural and functional characteristics of dopamine receptors. in this study a computational approach, integrating protein structure prediction, automated molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the dual action mechanism of spd on the d1 and d2 receptors, with the eventual aim to develop new drugs for treating diseases affecting the central nervous system such as schizophrenia. the dynamics simulations revealed the surface features of the electrostatic potentials and the conformational "open-closed" process of the binding entrances of two dopamine receptors. potential binding conformations of d1 and d2 receptors were obtained, and the d1-spd and d2-spd complexes were generated, which are in good agreement with most of experimental data. the d1-spd structure shows that the k-167_el-2-e-302_el-3 (el-2: extracellular loop 2; el-3: extracellular loop 3) salt bridge plays an important role for both the conformational change of the extracellular domain and the binding of spd. based on our modeling and simulations, we proposed a mechanism of the dual action of spd and a subsequent signal transduction model. further mutagenesis and biophysical experiments are needed to test and improve our proposed dual action mechanism of spd and signal transduction model.

mazindol analogues as potential inhibitors of the cocaine binding site at the dopamine transporter. a series of mazindol (2) and homomazindol (3) analogues with a variety of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in the pendant aryl group and the benzo ring c, as well as h, methoxy, and alkyl groups replacing the hydroxyl group were synthesized, and their binding affinities at the dopamine transporter (dat) on rat or guinea pig striatal membranes were determined. several active analogues were also evaluated for their ability to block uptake of da, 5-ht, and ne and inhibit binding of [(125)i] rti-55 at hek-hdat, hek-hsert, and hek-hnet cells. mazindane (26) was found to be a pro-drug, oxidizing (5-h --> 5-oh) to mazindol on rat striatal membranes and hek-hdat cells. the 4',7,8-trichloro analogue (38) of mazindol was the most potent and selective ligand for hek-hdat cells (dat k(i) = 1.1 nm; sert/dat = 1283 and net/dat = 38). experimental results strongly favor the cyclic or ol tautomers of 2 and 3 to bind more tightly at the dat than the corresponding keto tautomers.	mazindol @chemical@ cocaine binding site @gene@ @cpr:4@ mazindol @chemical@ dopamine transporter @gene@ @cpr:4@ 5-ht @chemical@ hsert @gene@ @cpr:9@ ne @chemical@ hnet @gene@ @cpr:9@ dopamine @chemical@ dopamine transporter @gene@ @cpr:9@ da @chemical@ hdat @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
loperamide modifies but does not block the corticotropin-releasing hormone-induced acth response in patients with addison's disease. the effect of loperamide - a peripheral opiate agonist - on plasma acth response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) has been investigated in 6 patients with addison's disease. after placebo administration crh induced a marked acth increase. after loperamide administration acth levels fell to a nadir of 135 +/- 76 pg/ml, and then crh was still able to induce an acth increase; the pattern of acth response to crh was slightly delayed. there was a significant difference between the two acth curves after crh only in the early phase of the response. these data suggest that the inhibitory role of loperamide on acth secretion is exerted at supra-pituitary level, although a pituitary site of action can not be excluded.	loperamide @chemical@ acth @gene@ @cpr:3@ loperamide @chemical@ acth @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
scientific evidence for traditional claim of antiobesity activity of tecomella undulata bark. ethnopharmacological relevance: the bark of tecomella undulata is traditionally claimed in the treatment of various disease ailments including obesity and cancer. till now there are no studies about anti obesity activity of tecomella undulata bark. aim of the study: the present study was aimed to establish a scientific evidence for anti obesity efficiency of ethyl acetate extract of tecomella undulata bark (eatub). further to standardize the active fractions of eatub using different biomarkers. materials and methods: we investigated activity of eatub fractions (f1-f7) using 3t3-l1 fibroblasts. further, f1-mediated effects were characterized by determining mrna and protein levels of sirt1, one of the key targets for the treatment of obesity, using semi quantitative rt-pcr (sqrt-pcr) and western blot analysis. the consequences of modulation of sirt1 on mrna and protein levels of various adipogenesis mediators like pparγ, c/ebpα, e2f1, leptin, adiponectin and lpl were also studied. in-vivo studies were performed using high fat diet (hfd) obese mice. results: our data showed that compared to controls, preadipocytes and adipocytes incubated with f1 exhibited a significant decrease in adipogenesis and lipogenesis. in addition, sqrt-pcr and western blot analysis showed significant increase in sirt1 and adiponectin levels and decrease in pparγ, c/ebpα, e2f1, leptin and lpl levels in preadipocytes and adipocytes. in-vivo studies of f1 in hfd induced obese mice showed significant improvement in lipid profile and glucose levels. the bioactive fraction (f1) was determined to possess 4.95% of ferulic acid. conclusion: thus, our findings signified the beneficial effects of tecomella undulata bark in pharmacologic interventions related to obesity and metabolic disorders. ferulic acid and rutin are being reported and quantified for the first time from the bark of tecomella undulata.	@norel@
influence of developmental lead exposure on expression of dna methyltransferases and methyl cytosine-binding proteins in hippocampus. developmental exposure to lead (pb) has adverse effects on cognitive functioning and behavior that can persist into adulthood. exposures that occur during fetal or early life periods may produce changes in brain related to physiological re-programming from an epigenetic influence such as altered dna methylation status. since dna methylation is regulated by dna methyltransferases and methyl cytosine-binding proteins, this study assessed the extent to which developmental pb exposure might affect expression of these proteins in the hippocampus. long evans dams were fed chow with or without added pb acetate (0, 150, 375, 750 ppm) prior to breeding and remained on the same diet through weaning (perinatal exposure group). other animals were exposed to the same doses of pb but exposure started on postnatal day 1 and continued through weaning (early postnatal exposure group). all animals were euthanized on day 55 and hippocampi were removed. western blot analyses showed significant effects of pb exposure on dnmt1, dnmt3a, and mecp2 expression, with effects often seen at the lowest level of exposure and modified by sex and developmental window of pb exposure. these data suggest potential epigenetic effects of developmental pb exposure on dna methylation mediated at least in part through dysregulation of methyltransferases.	@norel@
inactivation of factor xii active fragment in normal plasma. predominant role of c-1-inhibitor. to define the factors responsible for the inactivation of the active fragment derived from factor xii (factor xiif ) in plasma, we studied the inactivation kinetics of factor xiif in various purified and plasma mixtures. we also analyzed the formation of 125i-factor xiif -inhibitor complexes by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). in purified systems, the bimolecular rate constants for the reactions of factor xiif with c-1-inhibitor, alpha 2-antiplasmin, and antithrombin iii were 18.5, 0.91, and 0.32 x 10(4) m-1 min-1, respectively. furthermore, sds-page analysis revealed that 1:1 stoichiometric complexes were formed between 125i-factor xiif and each of these three inhibitors. in contrast, kinetic and sds-page studies indicated that factor xiif did not react with alpha 1-antitrypsin or alpha 2-macroglobulin. the inactivation rate constant of factor xiif by prekallikrein-deficient plasma was 14.4 x 10(-2) min-1, a value that was essentially identical to the value predicted from the studies in purified systems (15.5 x 10(-2) min-1). this constant was reduced to 1.8 x 10(-2) min-1 when factor xiif was inactivated by prekallikrein-deficient plasma that had been immunodepleted (less than 5%) of c-1-inhibitor. in addition, after inactivation in normal plasma, 74% of the active 125i-factor xiif was found to form a complex with c-1-inhibitor, whereas 26% of the enzyme formed complexes with alpha 2-antiplasmin and antithrombin iii. furthermore, 42% of the labeled enzyme was still complexed with c-1-inhibitor when 125i-factor xii was inactivated in hereditary angioedema plasma that contained 32% of functional c-1-inhibitor. this study quantitatively demonstrates the dominant role of c-1-inhibitor in the inactivation of factor xiif in the plasma milieu.	@norel@
schisandrin b protects against menadione-induced hepatotoxicity by enhancing dt-diaphorase activity. pretreating mice with schisandrin b (sch b), a dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative isolated from the fruit of schisandra chinensis, at a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days protected against menadione-induced hepatic oxidative damage in mice, as evidenced by decreases in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity (78%) and hepatic malondialdehyde level (70%), when compared with the menadione intoxicated control. in order to define the biochemical mechanism involved in the hepatoprotection afforded by sch b pretreatment, we examined the activity of dt-diaphorase (dtd) in hepatocytes isolated from sch b pretreated rats. hepatocytes isolated from sch b pretreated (a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days) rats showed a significant increase (25%) in dtd activity. the increase in dtd activity was associated with the enhanced rate of menadione elimination in the hepatocyte culture. the ensemble of results suggests that the ability of sch b pretreatment to enhance hepatocellular dtd activity may at least in part be attributed to the protection against menadione hepatotoxicity.	sch b @chemical@ dtd @gene@ @cpr:3@ schisandrin b @chemical@ dt-diaphorase @gene@ @cpr:3@ sch b @chemical@ dtd @gene@ @cpr:3@ menadione @chemical@ alanine aminotransferase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
apolipoprotein e3 (apoe3) safeguards pig proximal tubular llc-pk1 cells against reduction in sglt1 activity induced by gentamicin c. megalin, a family of endocytic receptors related to the low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor, is a major pathway for proximal tubular aminoglycoside accumulation. we previously reported that aminoglycoside antibiotics reduce sglt1-dependent glucose transport in pig proximal tubular epithelial llc-pk1 cells in parallel with the order of their nephrotoxicity. in this study, using a model of gentamicin c (gmc)-induced reduction in sglt1 activity, we examined whether ligands for megalin protect llc-pk1 cells from the gmc-induced reduction in sglt1 activity. we employed apolipoprotein e3 (apoe3) and lactoferrin as ligands for megalin. then the cells were treated with various concentrations of apoe3, lactoferrin and bovine serum albumin with or without 100 microg/ml of gmc, and the sglt1-dependent methyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside (amg) uptake and levels of sglt1 expression were determined. as a result, we demonstrated that the apoe3 significantly protects these cells from gmc-induced reduction in amg uptake, but neither lactoferrin nor albumin does. in accord with a rise in amg uptake activity, the mrna and protein levels of sglt1 were apparently up-regulated in the presence of apoe3. furthermore, we found that the uptake of [3h] gentamicin is decreased by apoe3, and that apoe3 showed obvious protection against the gmc-dependent n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosamidase (nag) release from llc-pk1 cells. thus, these results indicate that apoe3 could be a valuable tool for the prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.	aminoglycoside @chemical@ sglt1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gentamicin c @chemical@ sglt1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gmc @chemical@ sglt1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gmc @chemical@ sglt1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gentamicin c @chemical@ sglt1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ methyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside @chemical@ sglt1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amg @chemical@ sglt1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ aminoglycoside @chemical@ endocytic receptors @gene@ @cpr:9@ aminoglycoside @chemical@ low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
improved insulin sensitivity despite increased visceral adiposity in mice deficient for the immune cell transcription factor t-bet. low-grade inflammation in fat is associated with insulin resistance, although the mechanisms are unclear. we report that mice deficient in the immune cell transcription factor t-bet have lower energy expenditure and increased visceral fat compared with wild-type mice, yet paradoxically are more insulin sensitive. this striking phenotype, present in young t-bet(-/-) mice, persisted with high-fat diet and increasing host age and was associated with altered immune cell numbers and cytokine secretion specifically in visceral adipose tissue. however, the favorable metabolic phenotype observed in t-bet-deficient hosts was lost in t-bet(-/-) mice also lacking adaptive immunity (t-bet(-/-)xrag2(-/-)), demonstrating that t-bet expression in the adaptive rather than the innate immune system impacts host glucose homeostasis. indeed, adoptive transfer of t-bet-deficient, but not wild-type, cd4(+) t cells to rag2(-/-) mice improved insulin sensitivity. our results reveal a role for t-bet in metabolic physiology and obesity-associated insulin resistance.	@norel@
methionine adenosyltransferase ii beta subunit gene expression provides a proliferative advantage in human hepatoma. background & aims: of the 2 genes (mat1a, mat2a) encoding methionine adenosyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes s-adenosylmethionine, mat1a, is expressed in liver, whereas mat2a is expressed in extrahepatic tissues. in liver, mat2a expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. here, we identified the beta subunit as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. the beta subunit has been cloned and shown to lower the k(m) of methionine adenosyltransferase ii alpha2 (the mat2a product) for methionine and to render the enzyme more susceptible to s-adenosylmethionine inhibition. methods: methionine adenosyltransferase ii alpha2 and beta subunit expression was analyzed in human and rat liver and hepatoma cell lines and their interaction studied in huh7 cells. beta subunit expression was up- and down-regulated in human hepatoma cell lines and the effect on dna synthesis determined. results: we found that beta subunit is expressed in rat extrahepatic tissues but not in normal liver. in human liver, beta subunit expression associates with cirrhosis and hepatoma. beta subunit is expressed in most (hepg2, plc, and hep3b) but not all (huh7) hepatoma cell lines. transfection of beta subunit reduced s-adenosylmethionine content and stimulated dna synthesis in huh7 cells, whereas down-regulation of beta subunit expression diminished dna synthesis in hepg2. the interaction between methionine adenosyltransferase ii alpha2 and beta subunit was demonstrated in huh7 cells. conclusions: our findings indicate that beta subunit associates with cirrhosis and cancer providing a proliferative advantage in hepatoma cells through its interaction with methionine adenosyltransferase ii alpha2 and down-regulation of s-adenosylmethionine levels.	s-adenosylmethionine @chemical@ methionine adenosyltransferase ii alpha2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ s-adenosylmethionine @chemical@ mat2a @gene@ @cpr:4@ s-adenosylmethionine @chemical@ mat1a @gene@ @cpr:9@ s-adenosylmethionine @chemical@ mat1a @gene@ @cpr:9@ s-adenosylmethionine @chemical@ mat2a @gene@ @cpr:9@ s-adenosylmethionine @chemical@ methionine adenosyltransferase @gene@ @cpr:9@ methionine @chemical@ methionine adenosyltransferase ii alpha2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ methionine @chemical@ mat2a @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
protective effect of cinnamon polyphenols against stz-diabetic mice fed high-sugar, high-fat diet and its underlying mechanism. this study was designed to investigate the potential effects of 14days' intragastrically given of cinnamon polyphenols (cps) in treating diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (150mgkg(-1)) and fed high-sugar, high-fat diet. the diabetic mice model was successfully established through determining on fasting blood-glucose (fbg) test. as revealed by glucose oxidase (god) and radioimmunoassay (ria), both dimethyldiguanide (dc, 0.6gkg(-1)d(-1)) and cps (0.3, 0.6, 1.2gkg(-1)d(-1)) treatments significantly resulted in down-regulation of blood glucose and insulin levels in serum, while the levels of oxidative stress markers were markedly lowered through elisa assay. meanwhile, the pathological damage in islet with pancreatic beta cells was ameliorated by treatment of cps at different doses, as shown in he stain. at the same time, the treatments also caused notable reduction of inos, nf-κb expressions showing in western blot analysis. these findings demonstrate that cinnamon polyphenols can exert the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects through the mechanisms that may be associated with repairing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic mice and improving its anti-oxidative capacity, as well as attenuating cytotoxicity via inhibition of inos, nf-κb activation.	dimethyldiguanide @chemical@ insulin @gene@ @cpr:4@ polyphenols @chemical@ inos @gene@ @cpr:4@ polyphenols @chemical@ nf-κb @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
antigenotoxic potencies of a lichen species, evernia prunastri. in this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extract of evernia prunastri (huds.) willd. (mep) were studied using wp2, ames (ta1535 and ta1537) and sister chromatid exchange (sce) test systems. the results obtained from bacterial test systems demonstrated that mep has strong antimutagenic potencies on ta1537 and wp2 strains. the highest inhibition rates for mep on ta1537 and wp2 strains were 37.70% and 69.70%, respectively. according to the sce test system, mep reduced the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin. in order to clarify the mechanism underlying the antigenotoxic effects of mep, the antioxidants were determined. cotreatments of 5, 10 and 20 µg/ml concentrations of mep with aflatoxin b(1) decreased the frequencies of sce and the malondialdehyde level and increased amount of superoxide dismutase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase which were decreased by aflatoxin. the data obtained from this work have clearly shown that mep has significant antigenotoxic effects which are thought to be partly due to the antioxidant activities and antioxidant inducing capability of mep. this is the first report indicating the antigenotoxic activities of mep against several mutagen agents such as n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine, acridin and aflatoxin.	aflatoxin b(1) @chemical@ superoxide dismutase @gene@ @cpr:3@ aflatoxin @chemical@ glutathione peroxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
ph-responsive composite microspheres based on magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticle for drug delivery. ph-responsive composite microspheres, consisting of a core of fe3o4 nanoparticle, a sandwiched layer of mesoporous silica and a shell of crosslinked poly (methacrylic acid) (pmaa), were successfully synthesized via distillation precipitation polymerization. the pka of the composite microsphere increased with the increase in the crosslinking density. doxorubicin hydrochloride (dox) was applied as a model drug, and the behavior of drug storage/release was investigated. the cumulative release of dox-loaded composite microsphere in vitro showed that the drug release rate was much faster below its pka than that of above its pka. because ph of most tumor tissues was lower than that of normal tissues, the ph-responsive composite microspheres are promising drug delivery system especially for cancer therapy.	@norel@
phenolics content and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of legume fractions. two faba bean (vicia faba l.) subspecies major and minor and lentil seeds grown in algeria were separated into cotyledons and hulls. these fractions, together with their corresponding whole seeds, were extracted with two solvents, aqueous (70%) acetone and (80%) ethanol, and evaluated for antioxidant activity in relation to their phenolic contents. acetone selectively extracted tannins from faba beans. the hulls always exhibited high antioxidant activity, measured using the reducing power (rp), antiradical activity (dpph) or oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac) assays. aqueous ethanol (80%) extract of lentil hulls exhibited high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities preferentially inhibiting 15-lox (ic(50), 55 μg/ml), with moderate cox-1 (ic(50), 66 μg/ml) and cox-2 (ic(50), 119 μg/ml) inhibitory effects on the cox pathway, whereas faba bean hull extracts exerted relatively mild lox inhibitory activity.	ethanol @chemical@ 15-lox @gene@ @cpr:4@ ethanol @chemical@ cox-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ethanol @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ethanol @chemical@ cox @gene@ @cpr:4@ ethanol @chemical@ lox @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
pre-clinical pharmacology of zolmitriptan (zomig; formerly 311c90), a centrally and peripherally acting 5ht1b/1d agonist for migraine. zolmitriptan (zomig; formerly 311c90) is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht)1b/1d receptor agonist with proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or without preceding aura. the drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5ht1b/1d receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. consistent with its selectivity for 5ht1b/1d receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. in anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. this effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. these actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. in all of these effects, zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response. zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. this was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the viith cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3h]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (tnc) and nucleus tractus solitarius. direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the tnc after systemic administration. this novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. this property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.	zolmitriptan @chemical@ calcitonin-gene-related peptide @gene@ @cpr:4@ 311c90 @chemical@ 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht)1b/1d @gene@ @cpr:5@ zolmitriptan @chemical@ 5ht1b/1d @gene@ @cpr:5@ zolmitriptan @chemical@ 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht)1b/1d @gene@ @cpr:5@ zomig @chemical@ 5ht1b/1d @gene@ @cpr:5@ 311c90 @chemical@ 5ht1b/1d @gene@ @cpr:5@ zomig @chemical@ 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht)1b/1d @gene@ @cpr:5@ 
activation of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors potentiates heteromeric kainate receptors. kainate receptors (kars), a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are widely expressed in the central nervous system and are critically involved in synaptic transmission. kar activation is influenced by metabotropic glutamate receptor (mglu) signaling, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. we undertook studies to examine how mglu modulation affects activation of kars. confocal immunohistochemistry of rat hippocampus and cultured rat cortex revealed colocalization of the high-affinity kar subunits with group i mglu receptors. in hippocampal and cortical cultures, the calcium signal caused by activation of native kars was potentiated by activation of group i mglu receptors. in xenopus laevis oocytes, activation of group i mglu receptors potentiated heteromeric but not homomeric kar-mediated currents, with no change in agonist potency. the potentiation of heteromeric kars by mglu1 activation was attenuated by gdpβs, blocked by an inhibitor of phospholipase c or the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid (bapta), prolonged by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, but unaffected by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin a. protein kinase c (pkc) inhibition reduced the potentiation by mglu1 of gluk2/gluk5, and conversely, direct activation of pkc by phorbol 12-myristate,13-acetate potentiated gluk2/gluk5. using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified three serines (ser833, ser836, and ser840) within the membrane proximal region of the gluk5 c-terminal domain that, in combination, are required for mglu1-mediated potentiation of kars. together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of key residues in the c-terminal domain changes the overall charge of this domain, resulting in potentiated agonist responses.	phorbol 12-myristate,13-acetate @chemical@ pkc @gene@ @cpr:3@ phorbol 12-myristate,13-acetate @chemical@ gluk2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ phorbol 12-myristate,13-acetate @chemical@ gluk5 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid @chemical@ kars @gene@ @cpr:4@ 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid @chemical@ mglu1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ bapta @chemical@ kars @gene@ @cpr:4@ bapta @chemical@ mglu1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ okadaic acid @chemical@ phosphatase @gene@ @cpr:4@ okadaic acid @chemical@ kars @gene@ @cpr:4@ okadaic acid @chemical@ mglu1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ lavendustin a @chemical@ tyrosine kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ lavendustin a @chemical@ kars @gene@ @cpr:4@ lavendustin a @chemical@ mglu1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
comparison of cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity and ocular anti-inflammatory effects of ketorolac tromethamine and bromfenac sodium. objective: to compare the cyclooxygenase (cox) activity and anti-inflammatory effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) ketorolac tromethamine (ketorolac) and bromfenac sodium (bromfenac). methods: cyclooxygenase activity and selectivity was determined in vitro by measuring prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) production following incubation of varying concentrations of nsaid with human recombinant cox-1 or cox-2 and arachidonic acid. anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a rabbit model in which an ocular inflammatory response was induced by intravenous injection of 10 microg/kg lipopolysaccharide (lps). in study animals, one eye was treated with 50 microl (+/-) ketorolac 0.4% (acular ls) or bromfenac 0.09% (xibrom) and the other eye with 50 microl buffered saline. in control animals, both eyes were treated with vehicle. all animals were treated twice: 2 hours and 1 hour before lps. main outcome measures: pge(2) production in vitro, measured by enzyme immunoassay; fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-dextran leakage into the anterior chamber, measured by fluorophotometry; aqueous pge(2) levels in vivo, measured by elisa immunoassay. results: ketorolac was six times more active against cox-1 (ic(50) = 0.02 microm) than cox-2 (ic(50) = 0.12 microm) while bromfenac was approximately 32 times more active against cox-2 (ic(50) = 0.0066 microm) than cox-1 (ic(50) = 0.210 microm). in the animal model, both drugs resulted in nearly complete inhibition of fitc-dextran leakage and pge(2) production in the anterior chamber of treated eyes. there was also a 79% inhibition (p < 0.001) of fitc-dextran leakage in the contralateral eyes of bromfenac-treated rabbits, and a 22.5% inhibition (not statistically significant) in the contralateral eyes of ketorolac-treated rabbits. conclusions: ketorolac is relatively cox-1 selective while bromfenac is potently selective for cox-2 over cox-1. in the animal model, both ketorolac 0.4% and bromfenac 0.09% demonstrated maximal anti-inflammatory activity in treated eyes. only bromfenac 0.09% had a significant effect on the contralateral eye, suggesting possible systemic absorption of this drug.	ketorolac @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ketorolac @chemical@ cox-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ bromfenac @chemical@ cox-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ bromfenac @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ bromfenac sodium @chemical@ cyclooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ ketorolac tromethamine @chemical@ cyclooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ prostaglandin e(2) @chemical@ cyclooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:9@ pge(2) @chemical@ cyclooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
ovarian expression of insulin-like peptide 3 (insl3) and its receptor (rxfp2) during development of bovine antral follicles and corpora lutea and measurement of circulating insl3 levels during synchronized estrous cycles. insulin-like peptide 3 (insl3), a major product of testicular leydig cells, is also expressed by the ovary, but its functional role remains poorly understood. here, we quantified expression of insl3 and its receptor rxfp2 in theca interna cell (tic) and granulosa cell compartments of developing bovine antral follicles and in corpora lutea (cl). insl3 and rxfp2 mrna levels were much higher in tic than granulosa cell and increased progressively during follicle maturation with insl3 peaking in large (11-18 mm) estrogen-active follicles and rxfp2 peaking in 9- to 10-mm follicles before declining in larger (11-18 mm) follicles. expression of both insl3 and rxfp2 in cl was much lower than in tic. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed abundant expression of insl3 mrna and protein in tic. these observations indicate follicular tic rather than cl as the primary site of both insl3 production and action, implying a predominantly autocrine/paracrine role in tic. to corroborate the above findings, we showed that in vitro exposure of tic to a luteinizing concentration of lh greatly attenuated expression of both insl3 and its receptor while increasing progesterone secretion and expression of star and cyp11a1. moreover, in vivo, a significant cyclic variation in plasma insl3 was observed during synchronized estrous cycles. insl3 and estradiol-17β followed a similar pattern, both increasing after luteolysis, before falling sharply after the lh surge. thus, theca-derived insl3, likely from the dominant preovulatory follicle, is detectable in peripheral blood of cattle, and expression is down-regulated during luteinization induced by the preovulatory lh surge. collectively, these findings underscore the likely role of insl3 as an important intrafollicular modulator of tic function/steroidogenesis, while raising doubts about its potential contribution to cl function.	@norel@
suppression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase contributes to bleomycin-induced oxidative stress and fibrogenesis. pulmonary fibrosis is a serious and irreversible lung injury with obscure etiologic mechanisms and no effective treatment to date. this study explored a crucial link between oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrogenesis, focusing on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2), a core transcription factor in antioxidative regulation systems. treatment of c57 bl/6 mice with bleomycin increased fibroblast viability and collagen production and significantly downregulated nrf2. in addition, prominent oxidative stress was indicated by changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels. in a cell-based model, bleomycin suppressed nrf2 activation via extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation, enhancing intracellular reactive oxygen species in lung fibroblasts and stimulating abnormal cell proliferation and collagen secretion. to confirm this novel mechanism of bleomycin-induced fibrogenesis, we attempted to upregulate nrf2 and related antioxidant proteins in bleomycin-treated fibroblasts using a putative nrf2 activator, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, and the results showed that bleomycin-induced fibroblast proliferation and collagen content were attenuated through improved redox balance. collectively, these results disclose a potential regulatory mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis that will aid the development of new therapies.	caffeic acid phenethyl ester @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ bleomycin @chemical@ extracellular signal-related kinase @gene@ @cpr:3@ bleomycin @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ bleomycin @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ bleomycin @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
thermodynamic determination of the binding constants of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors by a displacement method. somatic angiotensin i-converting enzyme (s-ace) plays a central role in blood pressure regulation and has been the target of most antihypertensive drugs. a displacement isothermal titration calorimetry method has been used to accurately determine the binding constant of three strong s-ace inhibitors. under the experimental conditions studied in this work, the relative potency of the inhibitors was determined to be enalaprilat>lisinopril>captopril. we analyze the thermodynamic behaviour of the binding process using the new structural information provided by the ace structures, as well as the conformational changes that occur upon binding.	@norel@
specificity of zebrafish retinol saturase: formation of all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol and all-trans-7,8- dihydroretinol. metabolism of vitamin a, all-trans-retinol, leads to the formation of 11-cis-retinaldehyde, the visual chromophore, and all-trans-retinoic acid, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression through the retinoic acid receptor. enzymes and binding proteins involved in retinoid metabolism are highly conserved across species. we previously described a novel mammalian enzyme that saturates the 13-14 double bond of all-trans-retinol to produce all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, which then follows the same metabolic fate as that of all-trans-retinol. specifically, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol is transiently oxidized to all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid before being oxidized further by cyp26 enzymes. here, we report the identification of two putative retsat homologues in zebrafish, one of which, zebrafish retsat a (zretsat a), also had retinol saturase activity, whereas zebrafish retsat b (zretsat b) was inactive under similar conditions. unlike mouse retsat (mretsat), zretsat a had an altered bond specificity saturating either the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-retinol to produce either all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol, respectively. zretsat a also saturated the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinol (vitamin a2), a second endogenous form of vitamin a in zebrafish. the dual enzymatic activity of zretsat a displays a newly acquired specificity for the 13-14 double bond retained in higher vertebrates and also the evolutionarily preserved activity of bacterial phytoene desaturases and plant carotenoid isomerases. expression of zretsat a was restricted to the liver and intestine of hatchlings and adult zebrafish, whereas zretsat b was expressed in the same tissues but at earlier developmental stages. exogenous all-trans-retinol, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol led to the strong induction of the expression of the retinoic acid-metabolizing enzyme, cyp26a1, arguing for an active signaling function of dihydroretinoid metabolites in zebrafish. these findings point to a conserved function but altered specificity of retsat in vertebrates, leading to the generation of various dihydroretinoid compounds, some of which could have signaling functions.	all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol @chemical@ zebrafish retinol saturase @gene@ @cpr:9@ all-trans-7,8- dihydroretinol @chemical@ zebrafish retinol saturase @gene@ @cpr:9@ all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol @chemical@ zretsat a @gene@ @cpr:9@ all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol @chemical@ zretsat a @gene@ @cpr:9@ all-trans-retinol @chemical@ zretsat a @gene@ @cpr:9@ all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol @chemical@ cyp26 @gene@ @cpr:9@ all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinol @chemical@ zretsat a @gene@ @cpr:9@ vitamin a2 @chemical@ zretsat a @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
extracellular loop 3 (el3) and el3-proximal transmembrane helix 7 of the mammalian type i and type ii gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) receptors determine differential ligand selectivity to gnrh-i and gnrh-ii. mammalian type i and ii gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) receptors (gnrhrs) show differential ligand preference for gnrh-i and gnrh-ii, respectively. using a variety of chimeric receptors based on green monkey gnrhr-2 (gmgnrhr-2), a representative type ii gnrhr, and rat gnrhr, a representative type i gnrhr, this study elucidated specific domains responsible for this ligand selectivity. a chimeric gmgnrhr-2 with the extracellular loop 3 (el3) and el3-proximal transmembrane helix 7 (tmh7) of rat gnrhr showed a great increase in ligand sensitivity to gnrh-i but not to gnrh-ii. point-mutation studies indicate that four amino acids, leu/phe(7.38), leu/phe(7.43), ala/pro(7.46), and pro/cys(7.47) in tmh7 are critical for ligand selectivity as well as receptor conformation. furthermore, a combinatory mutation (pro(7.31)-pro(7.32)-ser(7.33) motif to ser-glu-pro in el3 and leu(7.38), leu(7.43), ala(7.46), and pro(7.47) to those of rat gnrhr) in gmgnrh-2 exhibited an approximately 500-fold increased sensitivity to gnrh-i, indicating that these residues are critical for discriminating gnrh-ii from gnrh-i. [trp(7)]gnrh-i and [trp(8)]gnrh-i but not [his(5)]gnrh-i exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmgnrhr-2 than native gnrh-i, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of gnrhs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type i and type ii gnrhrs. as a whole, these data suggest a molecular coevolution of ligands and their receptors and facilitate the understanding of the molecular interaction between gnrhs and their cognate receptors.	@norel@
tissue-type plasminogen activator acts as a cytokine that triggers intracellular signal transduction and induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene expression. tissue-type plasminogen activator (tpa), a serine protease well known for generating plasmin, has been demonstrated to induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) gene expression and protein secretion in renal interstitial fibroblasts. however, exactly how tpa transduces its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is unknown. this study investigated the mechanism by which tpa induces mmp-9 gene expression. both wild-type and non-enzymatic mutant tpa were found to induce mmp-9 expression in rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (nrk-49f), indicating that the actions of tpa are independent of its proteolytic activity. tpa bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (lrp-1) in nrk-49f cells, and this binding was competitively abrogated by the lrp-1 antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (pea-13) lacking lrp-1, tpa failed to induce mmp-9 expression. furthermore, tpa induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on the beta subunit of lrp-1, which was followed by the activation of mek1 and its downstream erk-1 and -2. blockade of erk-1/2 activation by the mek1 inhibitor abolished mmp-9 induction by tpa in nrk-49f cells. conversely, overexpression of constitutively activated mek1 induced erk-1/2 phosphorylation and mmp-9 expression. in mouse obstructed kidney, tpa, lrp-1, and mmp-9 were concomitantly induced in the renal interstitium. collectively, these results suggest that besides its classical proteolytic activity, tpa acts as a cytokine that binds to the cell membrane receptor lrp-1, induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, and triggers intracellular signal transduction, thereby inducing specific gene expression in renal interstitial fibroblasts.	serine @chemical@ matrix metalloproteinase-9 @gene@ @cpr:3@ serine @chemical@ plasmin @gene@ @cpr:3@ tyrosine @chemical@ mek1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tyrosine @chemical@ erk-1 and -2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
the in vivo antioxidant and antifibrotic properties of green tea (camellia sinensis, theaceae). the in vivo antioxidant and antifibrotic properties of green tea (camellia sinensis, theaceae) were investigated with a study of carbon tetrachloride (ccl(4))-induced oxidative stress and hepatic fibrosis in male icr mice. oral administration of green tea extract at doses of 125, 625 and 1250 mg/kg for 8 weeks significantly reduced (p<0.05) the levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (tbars) and protein carbonyls in the liver by at least 28% compared with that was induced by ccl(4) (1 ml/kg) in mice. moreover, green tea extract administration significantly increased (p<0.05) the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) and glutathione reductase (gsh-rd) in the liver. our study found that oral administration of green tea extract prevented ccl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis, as evidenced by a decreased hydroxyproline level in the liver and a reduced incidence of hepatic fibrosis by histological observations. these results indicate that green tea exhibits potent protective effects against ccl(4)-induced oxidative stress and hepatic fibrosis in mice by inhibiting oxidative damage and increasing antioxidant enzyme activities.	@norel@
inhibition of gentamicin binding to rat renal brush-border membrane by megalin ligands and basic peptides. our previous studies showed that coadministration of cytochrome c and a 20-residue basic peptide, n-wasp181-200 (nishtkekkkgkakkkrltk, pi=10.87) inhibits renal accumulation of gentamicin. in this study, we examined effects of ligands of megalin, an endocytic receptor involved in renal uptake of gentamicin, and basic peptides including n-wasp180-200 and its mutant peptides on gentamicin binding to isolated rat renal brush-border membrane (bbm). gentamicin binding to bbm was inhibited by megalin ligands, basic peptide fragments of cytochrome c, and n-wasp181-200 in a concentration-dependent manner. klotz plot analysis showed that n-wasp181-200 inhibited the binding of gentamicin in a competitive manner. by substituting glycines for lysines in n-wasp181-200 at positions 9 and 15, the inhibitory effect on gentamicin binding to bbm was reduced, which may be related to a decrease in the alpha-helix content in the peptide. gentamicin binding to bbm treated with trypsin, in which megalin completely disappeared, was significantly but not completely decreased compared with the native bbm. in addition, treatment of bbm with trypsin led to a decrease in the inhibitory effect of n-wasp181-200 on gentamicin binding. these observations support that megalin ligands and basic peptides including n-wasp181-200 decrease renal accumulation of gentamicin by inhibiting its binding to bbm of proximal tubule cells, partly interacting with megalin. in addition, the alpha-helix conformation may play an important role in the inhibitory effect of n-wasp181-200 on the binding of gentamicin to bbm.	@norel@
genetic linkage of fc gamma riia and fc gamma riiia and implications for their use in predicting clinical responses to cd20-directed monoclonal antibody therapy. background: polymorphisms in fcgammariia and fcgammariiia receptors are associated with responses to the cd20-directed immunoglobulin g1 (igg1) monoclonal antibody rituximab among patients with indolent lymphoma. at odds with the aforementioned clinical observations has been the finding that igg1 binding is impacted by polymorphisms in fcgammariiia but not fcgammariia. one possibility for this discrepancy might involve linkage of polymorphisms between fcgammariia and fcgammariiia. materials and methods: as such, we performed allelespecific polymerase chain reaction and directed sequencing of the genomic dna coding region of fcgammariia and fcgammariiia for 52 healthy individuals. results: two common polymorphisms were observed for fcgammariia (at positions 27 and 131) and fcgammariiia (at positions 48 and 158). importantly, we observed linkage among polymorphisms within and between fcgammariia and fcgammariiia, including the expression of histidine at fcgammariia-131 and valine at fcgammariiia, both of which are associated with enhanced responses to rituximab. the results of these studies demonstrate that there is wide linkage within and between polymorphisms in fcgammariia and fcgammariiia and might provide an explanation for why polymorphisms at fcgammariia are associated with rituximab responses despite a lack of impact on igg1 binding. conclusion: knowledge of such linkages could facilitate the development of diagnostic tests aimed at identifying patients who might be more suitable for treatment with rituximab and possibly other therapeutic antibodies.	@norel@
induction of the metabolic regulator txnip in fasting-induced and natural torpor. torpor is a physiological state characterised by controlled lowering of metabolic rate and core body temperature, allowing substantial energy savings during periods of reduced food availability or harsh environmental conditions. the hypothalamus coordinates energy homeostasis and thermoregulation, and plays a key role in directing torpor. we recently showed that mice lacking the orphan g protein coupled receptor gpr50 readily enter torpor in response to fasting, and have now used these mice to conduct a microarray analysis of hypothalamic gene expression changes related to the torpor state. this revealed a strong induction of thioredoxin interacting protein (txnip) in the hypothalamus of torpid mice, which was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr and western blot analyses. in situ hybridisation identified the ependyma lining the third ventricle as the principal site of torpor-related expression of txnip. to characterise further the relationship between txnip and torpor, we profiled txnip expression in mice during prolonged fasting, cold exposure, and 2-deoxyglucose-induced hypometabolism, as well as in naturally occurring torpor bouts in the siberian hamster. strikingly, pronounced upregulation of txnip expression was only observed in wt mice when driven into torpor, and during torpor in the siberian hamster. increase of txnip was not limited to the hypothalamus, with exaggerated expression in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and liver also demonstrated in torpid mice. given the recent identification of txnip as a molecular nutrient sensor important in the regulation of energy metabolism, our data suggest that elevated txnip expression is critical to regulating energy expenditure and fuel utilisation during the extreme hypometabolic state of torpor.	@norel@
decreased serum concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol are associated with increased risk of progression to impaired fasting glucose and diabetes. objective to study the association between vitamin d status and the risk of incident impaired fasting glucose (ifg) and diabetes in a population-based cohort of diabetes-free subjects. research design and methods in a historical prospective cohort study of subjects from the clalit health services database, which includes information on nearly 4 million people, diabetes-free subjects aged 40-70 years with serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-ohd) measurements available were followed for 2 years to assess the development of ifg and diabetes in five 25-ohd subgroups: ≥25, 25.1-37.5, 37.6-50, 50.1-75, and >75 nmol/l. results the baseline cohort included 117,960 adults: 83,526 normoglycemic subjects and 34,434 subjects with ifg. during follow-up, 8,629 subjects (10.3% of the normoglycemic group) developed ifg, and 2,162 subjects (1.8% of the total cohort) progressed to diabetes. a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, population group, immigrant status, bmi, season of vitamin d measurement, ldl and hdl cholesterol, triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and socioeconomic status revealed an inverse association between 25-ohd and the risk of progression to ifg and diabetes. the odds of transitioning from normoglycemia to ifg, from normoglycemia to diabetes, and from ifg to diabetes in subjects with a 25-ohd level ≤25 nmol/l were greater than those of subjects with a 25-ohd level >75 nmol/l [odds ratio 1.13 (95% ci 1.03-1.24), 1.77 (1.11-2.83), and 1.43 (1.16-1.76), respectively]. conclusions vitamin d deficiency appears to be an independent risk factor for the development of ifg and diabetes.	@norel@
multicenter trial of everolimus in pediatric renal transplant recipients: results at three year. there are few prospective clinical trials of mtor inhibitors (or proliferation signal inhibitors) combined with cni inhibitors in de novo pediatric renal transplantation. results reported here are from a multicenter, open-label study in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients (<or=16 yr), in which patients received everolimus with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for one yr, then entered an extension study for a further two yr. nineteen patients completed the one-yr study, of whom three discontinued study medication. fifteen of the remaining 16 patients entered the extension study, eight of whom were aged <10 yr (group 1) and seven were aged 10-16 yr (group 2). mean daily dose of everolimus during the first 36 months was 1.53 mg/m(2) bsa. biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in three patients in group 2 and in one patient in group 1. biopsy-proven chronic allograft rejection was reported in four patients (two in each age group). graft survival at one yr was 100%; one patient in group 2 lost their graft subsequently during the extension. for patients entering the extension, patient survival at three yr was 100%. there were three cases of viral infection, including one case of cytomegalovirus infection. at three yr, mean total cholesterol was 5.5 +/- 0.8 mm/l (213 +/- 31 mg/dl) and four patients received statin therapy. mean serum creatinine at 36 months was 96 +/- 36 microm/l (1.1 +/- 0.4 mg/dl). this is the first long-term prospective study to demonstrate that a regimen of everolimus, cyclosporine, and corticosteroids provides good efficacy, tolerability, and safety in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients.	@norel@
glucocorticosteroids affect functions of airway- and blood-derived human t-cell clones, favoring the th1 profile through two mechanisms. glucocorticosteroids (gcs) are beneficial in allergic asthma. gcs therapy results in reduced mrna expression of interleukin-4 (il-4) and il-5 in cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) but not of ifn-gamma. in vitro studies with blood-derived t cells, however, show inhibition of all three cytokines by gcs. we studied the effects of gcs on t cells from bal in vitro, namely th0-, th1, and th2-like clones; and we compared bal- with blood-derived clones. dexamethasone (dex) inhibited the anti-cd3-induced production of il-4, il-5 and ifn-gamma in all 20 clones tested. ifn-gamma production was inhibited significantly less than il-4 and il-5. dex enhanced the ratio ifn-gamma/il-4 (mean +/- sem: control, 28.7 +/- 17.6; with 10-7 m dex, 55.0 +/- 27.5, p<0.005). interestingly, two categories of clones were distinguished based on the effects of gcs on il-2 production and il-2r alpha expression and proliferation; 1) in low il-2 producers dex blocked il-2 production and decreased il-2r alpha expression and proliferation; 2) in high il-2 producers dex inhibited il-2 production partially and enhanced il-2r alpha expression and proliferation. anti-il-2 and anti-il2r alpha blocked the dex-induced increase in proliferation. high levels of added il-2 induced the second type of response. in conclusion, the production of il-4 and il-5 by t-cell clones (derived either from bal or blood) was more sensitive to inhibition by dex than that of ifn-gamma, which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticosteroids in patients with asthma. the differential effects of dex on the proliferation of high and low il-2 producers in vitro may implicate a selective outgrowth of th1-like t cells in vivo in patients treated with steroids.	dex @chemical@ il-2r alpha @gene@ @cpr:3@ dex @chemical@ ifn-gamma @gene@ @cpr:3@ dex @chemical@ il-4 @gene@ @cpr:3@ dex @chemical@ il-4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ ifn-gamma @gene@ @cpr:4@ gcs @chemical@ interleukin-4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gcs @chemical@ il-4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gcs @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ il-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ il-2r alpha @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ il-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ il-4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ ifn-gamma @gene@ @cpr:4@ dexamethasone @chemical@ il-4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dexamethasone @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dexamethasone @chemical@ ifn-gamma @gene@ @cpr:4@ dex @chemical@ cd3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gcs @chemical@ cytokines @gene@ @cpr:4@ dexamethasone @chemical@ cd3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
dasatinib (bms-354825) inhibits kitd816v, an imatinib-resistant activating mutation that triggers neoplastic growth in most patients with systemic mastocytosis. mastocytosis is associated with an activating mutation in the kit oncoprotein (kitd816v) that results in autophosphorylation of the kit receptor in a ligand-independent manner. this mutation is inherently resistant to imatinib and, to date, there remains no effective curative therapy for systemic mastocytosis associated with kitd816v. dasatinib (bms-354825) is a novel orally bioavailable src/abl inhibitor that has activity against multiple imatinib-resistant bcr-abl isoforms in vitro that is presently showing considerable promise in early-phase clinical trials of chronic myeloid leukemia (cml). pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that high nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib can be achieved safely in humans. in this study, we demonstrate significant inhibitory activity of dasatinib against both wild-type kit and the kitd816v mutation in the nanomolar range in in vitro and cell-based kinase assays. additionally, dasatinib leads to growth inhibition of a kitd816v-harboring human masto-cytosis cell line. significantly, dasatinib selectively kills primary neoplastic bone marrow mast cells from patients with systemic mastocytosis while sparing other hematopoietic cells. computer modeling suggests that the kitd816v mutation destabilizes the inactive conformation of the kit activation loop to which imatinib binds, but it is not predicted to impair binding of kit by dasatinib. based upon our results, further evaluation of dasatinib for the treatment of systemic masto-cytosis in clinical trials is warranted. moreover, dasatinib may be of clinical utility in other disease settings driven by activating kit mutations.	dasatinib @chemical@ kit @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ kit @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ d816v @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ kit @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ d816v @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ kit @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ d816v @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ d816v @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ src @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ src @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
characterization of steroidogenic enzyme expression in aldosterone-producing adenoma: a comparison with various human adrenal tumors. we analyzed the expression profiles of several steroidogenic enzymes in normal adrenals, aldosterone-producing adenomas (apa), cortisol-producing adenomas combined with cushing's syndrome (cpa) or with subclinical cushing's syndrome (scpa), and nonfunctioning adrenal adenomas (nfa) to clarify the nature and characteristics of steroidogenesis in apa. clinical data were collected for all subjects. in resected adrenal glands (normal adrenals, apa, cpa, scpa, and nfa), the mrna expression levels of the cyp17, hsd3b2, cyp11b1, and cyp11b2 genes were studied using real-time quantitative pcr and immunohistochemistry. the cyp11b2 mrna level in apa was significantly higher than that in other groups. the cyp17/hsd3b2 ratio for mrna in apa was significantly lower than those in the other groups. low ratio of cyp17/hsd3b2 with high expression of cyp11b2 seems to explain steroidogenic characteristics of apa.	@norel@
effect of thiazinotrienomycin b, an ansamycin antibiotic, on the function of epidermal growth factor receptor in human stomach tumor cells. thiazinotrienomycin b (tt-b), an ansamycin isolated from fermentation broths of streptomyces sp. mj672-m3, inhibited the growth in vitro of human stomach tumor sc-6 cells over 10 times more strongly than the growth of other human tumor cells, such as hela (cervix), t24 (bladder) and lx-1 (lung). the extent of growth inhibition by tt-b of sc-6, but not of lx-1 nor t24, was lowered in a competitive manner by raising serum concentrations in the culture medium. tt-b inhibited the cell cycle progression of sc-6 at an early stage of the progression from g0/g1 to s. the inhibition was again competitive with serum concentrations in the culture medium. no direct inhibition of dna synthesis was observed at the concentration range which caused the cell cycle arrest. tt-b and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-egfr) were antagonistic to each other in inhibiting the cell cycle progression of sc-6 from g0/g1 to s, suggesting that the two compounds share the same target, egfr. the kinase activity of egfr was little inhibited by tt-b in a cell-free system.	tt-b @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ tt-b @chemical@ egfr @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
disposition of a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, valdecoxib, in human. valdecoxib is a potent and specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, which is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and the dysmenorrhea pain. eight male human subjects each received a single 50-mg oral dose of [(14)c]valdecoxib. urine, feces, and blood samples were collected after administration of the radioactive dose. most of the radioactivity in plasma was associated with valdecoxib and the hydroxylated metabolite of valdecoxib (m1). the estimated terminal half-life for valdecoxib was about 7 h. about 76.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 18% of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces. valdecoxib was extensively metabolized in human, and nine phase i metabolites were identified. the primary oxidative metabolic pathways of valdecoxib involved hydroxylation at either the methyl group to form m1 or n-hydroxylation at the sulfonamide moiety to form m2. further oxidation of m1 led to the formation of several other phase i metabolites. oxidative breakdown of the n-hydroxy sulfonamide function group in m2 led to the formation of corresponding sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid metabolites. the o-glucuronide conjugate of m1 and n-glucuronide conjugate of valdecoxib were the major urinary metabolites, which accounted for 23.3 and 19.5% of the total administered dose, respectively. the remaining urinary metabolites were glucuronide conjugates of other phase i metabolites. only 3% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as unchanged parent, suggesting that renal clearance is insignificant for valdecoxib. absorption of valdecoxib was excellent since the recovery of unchanged valdecoxib in feces was <1% of the administered dose.	valdecoxib @chemical@ cyclooxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ valdecoxib @chemical@ cyclooxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
synthesis and in vivo evaluation of novel radiotracers for the in vivo imaging of the norepinephrine transporter. the (r,r) and (s,s) enantiomers of 2-[(2-methoxyphenoxy)phenylmethyl]morpholine (mener) have been radiolabelled with carbon-11 in good yield and at high specific activity. these radiotracers are close analogues of reboxetine, a potent and selective ligand for the norepinephrine transporter (net). they were examined as potential ligands for imaging net in vivo by positron emission tomography (pet). the in vivo brain distribution of both [(11)c]-labeled enantiomers were evaluated in rats. following tail-vein injection of the (r,r)-enantiomer regional brain uptake and washout of radioactivity was homogeneous at all time points examined (5-60 min). in contrast, administration of the (s,s)-enantiomer produced a heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity in brain with highest uptake in the hypothalamus, a net rich region, and lowest uptake in the striatum, a brain region devoid of net. hypothalamus to striatum ratios of 2.5 to one were achieved at 60 min post injection of (s,s)-[(11)c]-mener. pre-injection of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, reboxetine or desipramine, reduced hypothalamus to striatum ratios to near unity while reuptake inhibitors of dopamine and serotonin had no significant effect on binding. in vitro autoradiography studies (rat brain slices) with (s,s)-[(11)c]-mener produced a regional distribution pattern that was consistent with the reported distribution of net. (s,s)-[(11)c]-mener has the potential to be the first successful pet ligand to image net.	@norel@
a water-alcohol extract of citrus grandis whole fruits has beneficial metabolic effects in the obese zucker rats fed with high fat/high cholesterol diet. epidemiological studies suggest that citrus fruits and compounds such as flavonoids, limonoids and pectins have health promoting effects. our aim was to study the effects of citrus grandis (l.) osbeck var. tomentosa hort. fruit extract on the energy metabolism. a whole fruit powder from dry water and alcohol extracts of c. grandis containing 19% naringin flavonoid was prepared. the effects of the citrus extract were followed in the obese zucker rats fed with the hfd. the circulatory levels of glp-1 decreased significantly by the extract in comparison to the hfd group, whereas the decreased ghrelin levels were reversed. the levels of pyy were decreased in all hfd groups. the leptin amounts decreased but not significantly whereas insulin and amylin were unchanged. the cholesterol and glucose levels were somewhat but not systematically improved in the hfd fed rats. further studies are needed to identify the active compounds and their mechanisms.	@norel@
gemcitabine and pemetrexed disodium combinations in vitro and in vivo. pemetrexed disodium (alimta) is a novel antimetabolite that inhibits at least three folate-dependent enzymes, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. pemetrexed disodium is broadly active in a wide variety of solid tumours, including non-small cell lung, breast, bladder, head and neck and ovarian cancers. gemcitabine is a broadly active pyrimidine nucleoside antimetabolite, which is approved for the treatment of pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. three preclinical studies have been reported that show cytotoxic synergy between gemcitabine and pemetrexed. clinical activity with this combination has been observed in a phase i study, with partial responses in three of five patients previously treated for non-small cell lung cancer. an international phase ii study of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing.	pemetrexed disodium @chemical@ thymidylate synthase @gene@ @cpr:4@ pemetrexed disodium @chemical@ dihydrofolate reductase @gene@ @cpr:4@ pemetrexed disodium @chemical@ glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase @gene@ @cpr:4@ alimta @chemical@ thymidylate synthase @gene@ @cpr:4@ alimta @chemical@ dihydrofolate reductase @gene@ @cpr:4@ alimta @chemical@ glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone functionally antagonizes testosterone activation of the human androgen receptor in prostate cells through focal adhesion complexes involving hic-5. gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) analogs constitute the most widely employed medical treatment for prostatic cancer. the predominant mechanism of action is presumed to be via the inhibition of gonadotropins and resultant decrease in androgen. however, gnrh analogs have also been shown to directly inhibit prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo through antiproliferative cell cycle arrest and stimulation of apoptosis. since the gnrh receptor has been shown to affect sex steroid hormone receptor function, we considered that part of gnrh analog actions on prostate cells may be mediated through modulation of the human androgen receptor. using a model hek293 cell line expressing the gnrh receptor, we demonstrated a novel signalling pathway of the gnrh receptor that induces nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor that renders it transcriptionally inactive. this mechanism involves the calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase pyk2, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-src and the focal adhesion protein/steroid receptor co-factor, hic-5. in this setting there is a gnrh-induced association and nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor with hic-5. gnrh-induced pyk2 activation opposed the association of hic-5 with androgen receptor as overexpression of a dominant negative pyk2 enhanced the gnrh-induced nuclear translocation of a green fluorescent protein-tagged human androgen receptor. gnrh-induced c-src activation resulted in the phosphorylation of expressed hic-5 and promoted its association with the human androgen receptor. in contrast to testosterone, gnrh-induced nuclear translocation did not transcriptionally activate the androgen receptor. we then demonstrated that gnrh can also stimulate androgen receptor mobilization in human prostate pc3, bph-1 and lncap cells, and in cultured rat ventral prostate cells through the same mechanism. to determine if gnrh could antagonize androgen effects in normal tissue, we examined the effect of gnrh on rat ventral prostate organ cultures and demonstrated that gnrh can functionally antagonize the actions of testosterone on prostate cell proliferation and tissue growth. this antagonism of testosterone action by gnrh may underlie in part the capacity of gnrh receptor activation to inhibit prostate tumor growth.	testosterone @chemical@ human androgen receptor @gene@ @cpr:3@ gnrh @chemical@ pyk2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ gnrh @chemical@ c-src @gene@ @cpr:3@ testosterone @chemical@ androgen receptor @gene@ @cpr:3@ gnrh @chemical@ hic-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ gnrh @chemical@ androgen receptor @gene@ @cpr:4@ gonadotropin-releasing hormone @chemical@ human androgen receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
effects of felodipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) and analogues on calmodulin-dependent enzymes. we have examined the effects on the activities of three calmodulin-dependent enzymes (camp phosphodiesterase, caldesmon kinase and myosin light chain kinase) of the dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blocker felodipine and three analogues (p-chloro, oxidized and t-butyl) exhibiting different pharmacological potencies. the camp phosphodiesterase was inhibited completely by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue with ic50 values of 3.7 and 1.5 microm respectively. the oxidized and t-butyl analogues were relatively ineffective in inhibiting camp phosphodiesterase. felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the basal (ca2+/calmodulin-independent) activity of camp phosphodiesterase as well as the calmodulin-stimulated activity. calmodulin was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of camp phosphodiesterase by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue. these observations suggest that felodipine may act directly on the phosphodiesterase as well as through calmodulin. felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited ca2+/calmodulin-dependent caldesmon kinase with similar potencies (ic50 = 17.4 microm), whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues caused no inhibition. similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin light chain kinase activity whether the isolated 20 kd light chain (ic50 = 12.6 microm) or intact myosin (ic50 = 11.0 microm) was used as substrate. inhibition in each case was prevented by excess calmodulin. the oxidized and t-butyl derivatives caused little or no inhibition. finally, the effects of felodipine and the three analogues on two processes which are dependent on myosin phosphorylation were examined, namely the actin-activated mg2+-atpase activity of myosin and the assembly of myosin filaments. felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the actin-activated mg2+-atpase activity of smooth muscle myosin (ic50 = 25.1 microm). the oxidized and t-butyl analogues exhibited no inhibition. similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue blocked myosin filament assembly induced by low concentrations of calmodulin, whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues did not. again, inhibition of the actin-activated myosin mg2+-atpase and myosin filament assembly by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue could be reversed by raising the calmodulin concentration. these observations suggest that some of the pharmacological actions of felodipine on smooth muscle may involve inhibition of calmodulin-dependent enzymes which are functionally involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction.	p-chloro @chemical@ mg2+-atpase @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ ca2+ channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ mg2+-atpase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ mg2+-atpase @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ calmodulin-dependent enzymes @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ camp phosphodiesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ camp phosphodiesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ camp phosphodiesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ calmodulin @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ camp phosphodiesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ calmodulin @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ camp phosphodiesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ camp phosphodiesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ caldesmon kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ caldesmon kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ myosin light chain kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ calcium channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ dihydropyridine @chemical@ calcium channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ p-chloro @chemical@ myosin light chain kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ mg2+-atpase @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ myosin @gene@ @cpr:4@

neuroprotective effects of oxymatrine against excitotoxicity partially through down-regulation of nr2b-containing nmda receptors. oxymatrine (omt) is a major bioactive component derived from sophora flavescens ait (kushen), which is widely used in chinese medicine. recent studies have shown that it has neuroprotective effects; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. we focus on the mechanisms of pharmacologic action in omt by detecting its pharmacological properties against focal cerebral ischemia in vivo and nmda-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. omt prevented cerebral ischemic injury in mice induced via a 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion and a 24 h reperfusion, in vivo. in vitro cultured neurons challenged with n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda, 200 μm) for 30 min showed significant decrease in the viability of neurons; however, omt was able to protect neurons against induced neurotoxicity via nmda exposure. western blot analysis revealed that omt decreased the expression of bax and repaired the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. furthermore, omt significantly reversed the up-regulation of nr2b and inhibited the calcium overload in the cultured neurons after challenging the nmda. omt showed partial protection in the cortical neurons via down-regulation of nr2b containing nmda receptors and up-regulation of bcl-2 family. our results provide new insights into the development of natural therapeutic anti-oxidants against ischemia.	omt @chemical@ bcl-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ omt @chemical@ nmda receptors @gene@ @cpr:4@ omt @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:4@ omt @chemical@ nr2b @gene@ @cpr:4@ omt @chemical@ nr2b @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the prevalence of meeting a1c, blood pressure, and ldl goals among people with diabetes, 1988-2010. objectiveto determine the prevalence of people with diabetes who meet hemoglobin a(1c) (a1c), blood pressure (bp), and ldl cholesterol (abc) recommendations, and their current statin use, factors associated with goal achievement, and changes in the proportion achieving goals between 1988 and 2010.research and design methodsdata were cross-sectional from the national health and nutrition examination surveys (nhanes) from 1988-1994, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010. participants were 4,926 adults aged ≥20 years who self-reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes and completed the household interview and physical examination (n = 1,558 for valid ldl levels). main outcome measures were a1c, bp, and ldl cholesterol, in accordance with the american diabetes association recommendations, and current use of statins.resultsin 2007-2010, 52.5% of people with diabetes achieved a1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), 51.1% achieved bp <130/80 mmhg, 56.2% achieved ldl <100 mg/dl, and 18.8% achieved all three abcs. these levels of control were significant improvements from 1988 to 1994 (all p < 0.05). statin use significantly increased between 1988-1994 (4.2%) and 2007-2010 (51.4%, p < 0.01). compared with non-hispanic whites, mexican americans were less likely to meet a1c and ldl goals (p < 0.03), and non-hispanic blacks were less likely to meet bp and ldl goals (p < 0.02). compared with non-hispanic blacks, mexican americans were less likely to meet a1c goals (p < 0.01). younger individuals were less likely to meet a1c and ldl goals.conclusionsdespite significant improvement during the past decade, achieving the abc goals remains suboptimal among adults with diabetes, particularly in some minority groups. substantial opportunity exists to further improve diabetes control and, thus, to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.	@norel@
nuclear receptor car specifically activates the two-pore k+ channel kcnk1 gene in male mouse livers, which attenuates phenobarbital-induced hepatic hyperplasia. kcnk1, a member of the family of two-pore k(+) ion channels, is specifically induced in the livers of male mice after phenobarbital treatment. here, we have determined the molecular mechanism of this male-specific activation of the kcnk1 gene and characterized kcnk1 as a phenobarbital-inducible antihyperplasia factor. upon activation by phenobarbital, nuclear receptor car binds the 97-bp response element (-2441/-2345) within the kcnk1 promoter. this binding is observed in the livers of male mice, but not in the livers of female mice and requires the pituitary gland, because hypophysectomy abrogates it. hyperplasia further progressed in the livers of kcnk1 ( -/- ) male mice compared with those of kcnk1 ( +/+ ) males after phenobarbital treatment. thus, kcnk1 suppresses phenobarbital-induced hyperplasia. these results indicate that phenobarbital treatment induces kcnk1 to elicit a male-specific and growth-suppressing signal. thus, kcnk1 and kcnk1 ( -/- ) mice provide an experimental tool for further investigation into the molecular mechanism of car-mediated promotion of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.	phenobarbital @chemical@ kcnk1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ phenobarbital @chemical@ k(+) ion channels @gene@ @cpr:3@ phenobarbital @chemical@ kcnk1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ phenobarbital @chemical@ nuclear receptor @gene@ @cpr:3@ phenobarbital @chemical@ car @gene@ @cpr:3@ phenobarbital @chemical@ kcnk1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ phenobarbital @chemical@ kcnk1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
the yeast cap binding complex modulates transcription factor recruitment and establishes proper histone h3k36 trimethylation during active transcription. recent studies have revealed a close relationship between transcription, histone modification, and rna processing. in fact, genome-wide analyses that correlate histone marks with rna processing signals raise the possibility that specific rna processing factors may modulate transcription and help to "write" chromatin marks. here we show that the nuclear cap binding complex (cbc) directs recruitment of transcription elongation factors and establishes proper histone marks during active transcription. a directed genetic screen revealed that deletion of either subunit of the cbc confers a synthetic growth defect when combined with deletion of genes encoding either ctk2 or bur2, a component of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of p-tefb. the cbc physically associates with these complexes to recruit them during transcription and mediates phosphorylation at ser-2 of the c-terminal domain (ctd) of rna polymerase ii. to understand how these interactions influence downstream events, histone h3k36me3 was examined, and we demonstrate that cbcδ affects proper set2-dependent h3k36me3. consistent with this, the cbc and set2 have similar effects on the ability to rapidly induce and sustain activated gene expression, and these effects are distinct from other histone methyltransferases. this work provides evidence for an emerging model that rna processing factors can modulate the recruitment of transcription factors and influence histone modification during elongation.	@norel@
a novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 positive allosteric modulator acts at a unique site and confers stimulus bias to mglu5 signaling. metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mglu5) is a target for the treatment of central nervous system (cns) disorders, such as schizophrenia and alzheimer's disease. furthermore, mglu5 has been shown to play an important role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically in long-term depression (ltd) and long-term potentiation (ltp), which is thought to be involved in cognition. multiple mglu5-positive allosteric modulators (pams) have been developed from a variety of different scaffolds. previous work has extensively characterized a common allosteric site on mglu5, termed the mpep (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine) binding site. however, one mglu5 pam, cppha (n-(4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2h-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide), interacts with a separate allosteric site on mglu5. using cell-based assays and brain slice preparations, we characterized the interaction of a potent and efficacious mglu5 pam from the cppha series termed ncfp (n-(4-chloro-2-((4-fluoro-1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)methyl)phenyl)picolinamide). ncfp binds to the cppha site on mglu5 and potentiates mglu5-mediated responses in both recombinant and native systems. however, ncfp provides greater mglu5 subtype selectivity than does cppha, making it more suitable for studies of effects on mglu5 in cns preparations. of interest, ncfp does not potentiate responses involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (ltd/ltp), setting it apart from other previously characterized mpep site pams. this suggests that although mglu5 pams may have similar responses in some systems, they can induce differential effects on mglu5-mediated physiologic responses in the cns. such stimulus bias by mglu5 pams may complicate drug discovery efforts but would also allow for specifically tailored therapies, if pharmacological biases can be attributed to different therapeutic outcomes.	ncfp @chemical@ mglu5 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
the prostaglandin e series modulates high-voltage-activated calcium channels probably through the ep3 receptor in rat paratracheal ganglia. the modulation of high-voltage-activated (hva) ca2+ channels by the prostaglandin e series (pge1 and pge2) was studied in the paratracheal ganglion cells. prostaglandin e1, e2, sta2 (a stable analogue of thromboxane a2), 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2 (an ep1-selective agonist) and sulprostone (an ep3-selective agonist) inhibited the hva ca2+ current (hva ica) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit hva ca2+ channels was sulprostone>pge2, pge1>sta2>>17-phenyl-trinor-pge2. sc-51089 (10(-5) m), a selective ep1-receptor antagonist, showed no effect on the pge1- or pge2-induced inhibition of the hva ica, thereby indicating that pge1- and pge2-induced inhibition of the hva ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the ep3 receptor. the pge1-sensitive component of the current was markedly reduced in the presence of omega-conotoxin-gvia (3x10(-6) m), but not with nifedipine (3x10(-6) m). pge1 and pge2 also inhibited the remaining ica in a saturating concentration of nifedipine, omega-conotoxin-gvia and omega-conotoxin-mviic, suggesting that r-type ca2+ channels are involved. the inhibitory effect of pge1 or sulprostone was prevented by pretreatment with pertussis toxin [islet activating protein (iap)] or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (pma), and the protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor chelerythrine blocked the action of pma. it was concluded that pge1 selectively reduces both n- and r-type ca2+ currents by activating a g-protein probably through the ep3 receptor in paratracheal ganglion cells.	pge1 @chemical@ g-protein @gene@ @cpr:3@ 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ sta2 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ thromboxane a2 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulprostone @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulprostone @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ pge2 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ pge1 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ sta2 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ pge1 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ pge2 @chemical@ hva ca2+ channels @gene@ @cpr:4@ chelerythrine @chemical@ protein kinase c @gene@ @cpr:4@ chelerythrine @chemical@ pkc @gene@ @cpr:4@ 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2 @chemical@ ep1 @gene@ @cpr:5@ sulprostone @chemical@ ep3 @gene@ @cpr:5@ sc-51089 @chemical@ ep1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
phenothiazines inhibit s100a4 function by inducing protein oligomerization. s100a4, a member of the s100 family of ca(2+)-binding proteins, regulates carcinoma cell motility via interactions with myosin-iia. numerous studies indicate that s100a4 is not simply a marker for metastatic disease, but rather has a direct role in metastatic progression. these observations suggest that s100a4 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. using a unique biosensor-based assay, trifluoperazine (tfp) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the s100a4/myosin-iia interaction. to examine the interaction of s100a4 with tfp, we determined the 2.3 a crystal structure of human ca(2+)-s100a4 bound to tfp. two tfp molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of ca(2+)-s100a4 with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. nmr chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that tfp binds to the target binding cleft of s100a4 in solution. remarkably, tfp binding results in the assembly of five ca(2+)-s100a4/tfp dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. within each pentamer most of the contacts between s100a4 dimers occurs through the tfp moieties. the ca(2+)-s100a4/prochlorperazine (pcp) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized s100a4/tfp oligomer in solution. assays examining the ability of tfp to block s100a4-mediated disassembly of myosin-iia filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of s100a4 function occurs only at tfp concentrations that promote s100a4 oligomerization. together these studies support a unique mode of inhibition in which phenothiazines disrupt the s100a4/myosin-iia interaction by sequestering s100a4 via small molecule-induced oligomerization.	tfp @chemical@ s100a4 @gene@ @cpr:3@ trifluoperazine @chemical@ s100a4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ trifluoperazine @chemical@ myosin-iia @gene@ @cpr:4@ tfp @chemical@ s100a4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tfp @chemical@ myosin-iia @gene@ @cpr:4@ phenothiazines @chemical@ s100a4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tfp @chemical@ s100a4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tfp @chemical@ myosin-iia @gene@ @cpr:4@ tfp @chemical@ s100a4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ phenothiazines @chemical@ s100a4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ phenothiazines @chemical@ myosin-iia @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the use of insulin analogues in pregnancy. excellent glycaemic control is essential in pregnancy to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes. the aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in pregnancy. insulin lispro and insulin aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 diabetes. however, a lack of data indicating improved foetal outcomes would suggest that there is no imperative to switch to a short-acting analogue where the woman's diabetes is well controlled with human insulin. there are no reports of the use of insulin glulisine in pregnancy and so its use cannot be recommended. most studies of insulin glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. there appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue insulin glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control. a head-to-head comparison between insulin detemir and nph insulin in women with type 1 diabetes showed that while foetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma glucose improved with insulin detemir without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. the greater evidence base supports the use of insulin detemir as the first line long-acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive foetal benefits means that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on nph insulin. there seems little justification in using long acting insulin analogues in women with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is low.	glucose @chemical@ insulin @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
torasemide inhibits angiotensin ii-induced vasoconstriction and intracellular calcium increase in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats. torasemide is a loop diuretic that is effective at low once-daily doses in the treatment of arterial hypertension. because its antihypertensive mechanism of action may not be based entirely on the elimination of salt and water from the body, a vasodilator effect of this drug can be considered. in the present study, the ability of different concentrations of torasemide to modify angiotensin ii (ang ii)-induced vascular responses was examined, with the use of an organ bath system, in endothelium-denuded aortic rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats. ang ii-induced increases of intracellular free calcium concentration ([ca(2+)](i)) were also examined by image analysis in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats. a dose-response curve to ang ii was plotted for cumulative concentrations (from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/l) in endothelium-denuded aortic rings (pd(2)=7.5+/-0.3). isometric contraction induced by a submaximal concentration of ang ii (10(-7) mol/l) was reduced in a dose-dependent way by torasemide (ic(50)=0.5+/-0.04 micromol/l). incubation of vsmcs with different concentrations of ang ii (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/l) resulted in a dose-dependent rise of [ca(2+)](i) (pd(2)=7.5+/-0.3). the stimulatory effect of [ca(2+)](i) induced by a submaximal concentration of ang ii (10(-7) mol/l) was blocked by torasemide (ic(50)=0.5+/-0.3 nmol/l). our findings suggest that torasemide blocks the vasoconstrictor action of ang ii in vitro. this action can be related to the ability of torasemide to block the increase of [ca(2+)](i) induced by ang ii in vsmcs. it is proposed that these actions might be involved in the antihypertensive effect of torasemide observed in vivo.	torasemide @chemical@ angiotensin ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ torasemide @chemical@ ang ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ torasemide @chemical@ ang ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ torasemide @chemical@ ang ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ torasemide @chemical@ ang ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
enzymatic characterization of a recombinant isoform hybrid of glutamic acid decarboxylase (rgad67/65) expressed in yeast. background and aims: glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad, ec 4.1.1.15) catalyses the conversion of glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba). the 65 kda isoform, gad65 is a potent autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, whereas gad67 is not. a hybrid cdna was created by fusing a human cdna for amino acids 1-101 of gad67 to a human cdna for amino acids 96-585 of gad65; the recombinant (r) protein was expressed in yeast and was shown to have equivalent immunoreactivity to mammalian brain gad with diabetes sera. we here report on enzymatic and molecular properties of rgad67/65. methods: studies were performed on enzymatic activity of rgad67/65 by production of 3h-gaba from 3h-glutamate, enzyme kinetics, binding to the enzyme cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (plp), stability according to differences in ph, temperature and duration of storage, and antigenic reactivity with various gad-specific antisera. results: the properties of rgad67/65 were compared with published data for mammalian brain gad (brackets). these included a specific enzyme activity of 22.7 (16.7) nkat, optimal ph for enzymatic activity 7.4 (6.8), k(m) of 1.3 (1.3) mm, efficient non-covalent binding to the cofactor plp, and high autoantigenic potency. the stability of rgad67/65 was optimal over 3 months at -80 degrees c, or in lyophilized form at -20 degrees c. conclusions: hybrid rgad67/65 has enzymatic and other properties similar to those of the mixed isoforms of gad in preparations from mammalian brain as described elsewhere, in addition to its previously described similar immunoreactivity.	gamma-aminobutyric acid @chemical@ glutamic acid decarboxylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ gamma-aminobutyric acid @chemical@ gad @gene@ @cpr:9@ gamma-aminobutyric acid @chemical@ ec 4.1.1.15 @gene@ @cpr:9@ gaba @chemical@ glutamic acid decarboxylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ gaba @chemical@ gad @gene@ @cpr:9@ gaba @chemical@ ec 4.1.1.15 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamate @chemical@ glutamic acid decarboxylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamate @chemical@ gad @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamate @chemical@ ec 4.1.1.15 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
apple polyphenols suppress antigen presentation of ovalbumin by thp-1-derived dendritic cells. apple polyphenol extract (ap) and procyanidin contained in ap were investigated for their immunomodulatory effects using thp-1-derived human dendritic cells (tddcs). the expression levels of hla-dr (mhc class ii) and cd86 (costimulatory molecule) were measured as an indicator of antigen presentation in tddcs. a significant decrease in hla-dr expression was observed in the ap and fractionated procyanidin-treated cells in the presence of ovalbumin (ova), but no effect on cd86 expression was observed. the uptake of ova was not inhibited by ap treatment, and the gene expression of membrane-associated ring-ch ubiquitin e3 ligase, march1, was up-regulated by ap treatment. it can therefore be presumed that ap suppresses hla-dr expression via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. furthermore, the up-regulation of il-12 and tnf-α was found in the procyanidin trimers-treated cells in the presence of ova. these results suggest that apple polyphenols would be an effective factor for the development of immunomodulatory agents with suppressive effects of antigen presentation.	procyanidin @chemical@ il-12 @gene@ @cpr:3@ procyanidin @chemical@ tnf-α @gene@ @cpr:3@ polyphenols @chemical@ ovalbumin @gene@ @cpr:4@ procyanidin @chemical@ hla-dr @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
atypical and typical antipsychotic drug interactions with the dopamine d2 receptor. a model of the dopamine d2 receptor was used to study the receptor interactions of dopamine, the typical antipsychotics haloperidol and loxapine, and the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and melperone. the atypical antipsychotics interacted with the halogen atom of the ring system in the direction of the transmembrane helices (tmhs) 2, 3 and 7, while the typical had the corresponding halogen atom in the direction of tmh5. molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the average helical displacement upon binding increased in the order: typical < atypical < dopamine. upon binding, the atypical induced larger displacements into tmh5 than did the typical. the typical had stronger non-bonded interactions with the receptor than had the atypical, which is in agreement with the experimental observation that the atypical antipsychotic drugs dissociate faster from the receptor than the typical antipsychotic drugs.	@norel@
influence of chain length and double bond on the aqueous behavior of choline carboxylate soaps. in preceding studies, we demonstrated that choline carboxylates chc(m) with alkyl chain lengths of m = 12 - 18 are highly water-soluble (for m = 12, soluble up to 93 wt % soap and 0 °c). in addition, choline soaps are featured by an extraordinary lyotropic phase behavior. with decreasing water concentration, the following phases were found: micellar phase (l(1)), discontinuous cubic phase (i(1)' and i(1)"), hexagonal phase (h(1)), bicontinuous cubic phase (v(1)), and lamellar phase (l(α)). the present work is also focused on the lyotropic phase behavior of choline soaps but with shorter alkyl chains or different alkyl chain properties. we have investigated the aqueous phase behavior of choline soaps with c(8) and c(10) chain-lengths (choline octanoate and choline decanoate) and with a c(18) chain-length with a cis-double bond (choline oleate). we found that choline decanoate follows the lyotropic phase behavior of the longer-chain homologues mentioned above. choline octanoate in water shows no discontinuous cubic phases, but an extended, isotropic micellar solution phase. in addition, choline octanoate is at the limit between a surfactant and a hydrotrope. the double bond in choline oleate leads also to a better solubility in water and a decrease of the solubilization temperature. it also influences the gaussian curvature of the aggregates which results in a loss of discontinuous cubic phases in the binary phase diagram. the different lyotropic mesophases were identified by the penetration scan technique with polarizing light microscope and visual observations. to clarify the structural behavior small (saxs) and wide (waxs) angle x-ray scattering were performed. to further characterize the extended, isotropic micellar solution phase in the binary phase diagram of choline octanoate viscosity and conductivity measurements were also carried out.	@norel@
histone deacetylase inhibition affects sodium iodide symporter (nis) expression and induces ¹³¹i cytotoxicity in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. background: anaplastic thyroid cancers (atc) represent only 1-2% of all thyroid tumors, but they account for up to 50% of the mortality. treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinomas is well standardized and the use of radioiodine represents an essential step; in contrast, there is no standardized therapeutic approach for anaplastic tumors and their prognosis is poor. the resistance of anaplastic thyroid cancer to radioiodine treatment is principally due to the absence of expression of the sodium iodide symporter (nis), mainly due to epigenetic silencing. the acetylation status of histones is involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression and is usually disrupted in advanced thyroid cancer. histone deacetylase inhibitors have been demonstrated as potent anticancer drugs with several different effects on cell viability and differentiation. methods: stabilized anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (bht-101 and cal-62) and primary cultures from patients who underwent thyroidectomy for anaplastic thyroid cancer were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor lbh589. after treatment, we evaluated the expression and function of nis. gene expression was evaluated by real-time pcr (rt-pcr); nis promoter activity was determined with a luciferase reporter assay; and protein expression was assessed through immunofluorescence. we tested the protein function by 125i uptake and efflux experiments; finally the cytotoxic effect of 131i was determined with a clonogenic assay. results: our results demonstrate that treatment with lbh589 leads to nis rna expression as shown by rt-pcr and luciferase assay, and to protein expression as determined by immunofluorescence in vitro and by immunohistochemistry in xenograft tumors. moreover, 125i uptake and efflux experiments show the correct protein function and iodine retention, that translate into cytotoxicity effects, as demonstrated by a clonogenic assay with 131i . conclusions: this study supplies a new potential strategy for the treatment of atc by modifying gene expression with the aim of inducing responsiveness towards radioiodine therapy.	lbh589 @chemical@ nis @gene@ @cpr:3@ lbh589 @chemical@ histone deacetylase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
structure-based design of aliskiren, a novel orally effective renin inhibitor. hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, the leading causes of death in the western world. inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (ras) have proven to be successful treatments for hypertension. as renin specifically catalyses the rate-limiting step of the ras, it represents the optimal target for ras inhibition. several peptide-like renin inhibitors have been synthesized previously, but poor pharmacokinetic properties meant that these compounds were not clinically useful. we employed a combination of molecular modelling and crystallographic structure analysis to design renin inhibitors lacking the extended peptide-like backbone of earlier inhibitors, for improved pharmacokinetic properties. this led to the discovery of aliskiren, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of human renin in vitro, and in vivo; once-daily oral doses of aliskiren inhibit renin and lower blood pressure in sodium-depleted marmosets and hypertensive human patients. aliskiren represents the first in a novel class of renin inhibitors with the potential for treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.	aliskiren @chemical@ renin @gene@ @cpr:4@ aliskiren @chemical@ human renin @gene@ @cpr:4@ aliskiren @chemical@ renin @gene@ @cpr:4@ aliskiren @chemical@ renin @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with (-)-galanthamine at 2.3 a resolution. (-)-galanthamine (gal), an alkaloid from the flower, the common snowdrop (galanthus nivalis), shows anticholinesterase activity. this property has made gal the target of research as to its effectiveness in the treatment of alzheimer's disease. we have solved the x-ray crystal structure of gal bound in the active site of torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (tcache) to 2.3 a resolution. the inhibitor binds at the base of the active site gorge of tcache, interacting with both the choline-binding site (trp-84) and the acyl-binding pocket (phe-288, phe-290). the tertiary amine group of gal does not interact closely with trp-84; rather, the double bond of its cyclohexene ring stacks against the indole ring. the tertiary amine appears to make a non-conventional hydrogen bond, via its n-methyl group, to asp-72, near the top of the gorge. the hydroxyl group of the inhibitor makes a strong hydrogen bond (2.7 a) with glu-199. the relatively tight binding of gal to tcache appears to arise from a number of moderate to weak interactions with the protein, coupled to a low entropy cost for binding due to the rigid nature of the inhibitor.	@norel@
a comparison of the effects of nabumetone vs meloxicam on serum thromboxane b2 and platelet function in healthy volunteers. aims: to compare the effects of nabumetone and meloxicam, two cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) preferential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), on platelet cox-1 activity and platelet function. methods: twelve healthy volunteers (3 male, 9 female, median age 22 years) participated in an open, randomized, cross-over trial of nabumetone 1000 mg twice daily vs meloxicam 7.5 mg twice daily during 1 week with 2 weeks wash-out. after a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of indomethacin 50 mg was given as a positive control to check for nsaid induced inhibition of platelet function. cox-1 inhibition was measured as percentage inhibition of serum txb2 generation in clotting whole blood, and as closure time with use of the platelet function analyser pfa-100. data are reported as median with range. paired variables were analysed using wilcoxons signed rank test. results: txb2 levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but percentage inhibition after nabumetone and indomethacin (88% and 97%, respectively) was significantly higher than after meloxicam (63%) (p<0.05). closure times increased significantly after administration of all three medications (p<0.05). increases in closure time after administration did not differ between nabumetone and meloxicam (24% and 14%, respectively), but were significantly larger after indomethacin administration (63%) (p<0.01). conclusions: in the maximum registered dosage, nabumetone inhibits thromboxane production much more than meloxicam, signifying less cox-2 selectivity of the former. however, both nabumetone and meloxicam cause only minor impairment in platelet function in comparison with indomethacin and the difference between them is not significant.	nabumetone @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ txb2 @chemical@ cox-1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
a high throughput assay for the glucuronidation of 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin by recombinant human udp-glucuronosyltransferases and liver microsomes. abstract 1.  udp-glucuronosyltransferases (ugts) are versatile and important conjugation enzymes in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. 2.  we have developed a convenient quantitative multi-well plate assay to measure the glucuronidation rate of 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (hfc) for several ugts. 3.  we have used this method to screen 11 recombinant human ugts for hfc glucuronidation activity and studied the reaction kinetics with the most active enzymes. we have also examined the hfc glucuronidation activity of liver microsomes from human, pig, rabbit and rat. 4.  at a substrate concentration of 20 µm, the most active hfc glucuronidation catalysts were ugt1a10 followed by ugt1a6 >ugt1a7 >ugt2a1, whereas at 300 µm ugt1a6 was about 10 times better catalyst than the other recombinant ugts. the activities of ugts 1a3, 1a8, 1a9, 2b4 and 2b7 were low, whereas ugt1a1 and ugt2b17 exhibited no hfc glucuronidation activity. ugt1a6 exhibited a significantly higher vmax and km values toward both hfc and udp-glucuronic acid than the other ugts. 5.  human, pig and rabbit, but not rat liver microsomes, catalyzed hfc glucuronidation at high rates. 6.  this new method is particularly suitable for fast activity screenings of ugts 1a6, 1a7, 1a10 and 2a1 and hfc glucuronidation activity determination from various samples.	hfc @chemical@ ugt1a10 @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugt1a6 @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugt1a7 @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugt2a1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugt1a6 @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugts @gene@ @cpr:9@ 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin @chemical@ human udp-glucuronosyltransferases @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugts @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugt1a6 @gene@ @cpr:9@ udp @chemical@ ugts @gene@ @cpr:9@ udp @chemical@ ugt1a6 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glucuronic acid @chemical@ ugts @gene@ @cpr:9@ glucuronic acid @chemical@ ugt1a6 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin @chemical@ ugts @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ ugts @gene@ @cpr:9@ hfc @chemical@ human ugts @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
prosocial effects of oxytocin in two mouse models of autism spectrum disorders. clinical evidence suggests that oxytocin treatment improves social deficits and repetitive behavior in autism spectrum disorders (asds). however, the neuropeptide has a short plasma half-life and poor ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. in order to facilitate the development of more bioavailable oxytocinergic compounds as therapeutics to treat core asd symptoms, small animal models must be validated for preclinical screens. this study examined the preclinical utility of two inbred mouse strains, balb/cbyj and c58/j, that exhibit phenotypes relevant to core asd symptoms. mice from both strains were intraperitoneally administered oxytocin, using either acute or sub-chronic regimens. acute oxytocin did not increase sociability in balb/cbyj; however, sub-chronic oxytocin had significant prosocial effects in both balb/cbyj and c58/j. increased sociability was observed 24 hours following the final oxytocin dose in balb/cbyj, while prosocial effects of oxytocin emerged 1-2 weeks post-treatment in c58/j. furthermore, acute oxytocin decreased motor stereotypy in c58/j and did not induce hypoactivity or anxiolytic-like effects in an open field test. this study demonstrates that oxytocin administration can attenuate social deficits and repetitive behavior in mouse models of asd, dependent on dose regimen and genotype. these findings provide validation of the balb/cbyj and c58/j models as useful platforms for screening novel drugs for intervention in asds and for elucidating the mechanisms contributing to the prosocial effects of oxytocin.	@norel@
lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination of organic anion transporter-1 is essential for its protein kinase c-regulated endocytosis. organic anion transporter-1 (oat1) mediates the body's disposition of a diverse array of environmental toxins and clinically important drugs. therefore, understanding the regulation of this transporter has profound clinical significance. we had previously established that oat1 undergoes constitutive internalization from and recycling back to the cell surface and that acute activation of protein kinase c (pkc) inhibits oat1 activity by reducing oat1 cell-surface expression through accelerating its internalization from cell surface to intracellular compartments. however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. in the current study, we provide novel evidence that acute activation of pkc significantly enhances oat1 ubiquitination both in vitro and ex vivo. we further show that ubiquitination of cell-surface oat1 increases in cells transfected with dominant negative mutant of dynamin-2, a maneuver blocking oat1 internalization, which suggests that oat1 ubiquitination proceeds before oat1 internalization. mass spectroscopy has revealed that ubiquitination of oat1 consists of polyubiquitin chains, primarily through lysine 48 linkage. transfection of cells with the dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin ub-k48r, which prevents the formation of lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, abolishes pkc-stimulated oat1 ubiquitination and internalization. together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that lys48-linked polyubiquitination is essential for pkc-regulated oat1 trafficking.	@norel@
loss of a primordial identity element for a mammalian mitochondrial aminoacylation system. in mammalian mitochondria the translational machinery is of dual origin with trnas encoded by a simplified and rapidly evolving mitochondrial (mt) genome and aminoacyl-trna synthetases (aars) coded by the nuclear genome, and imported. mt-trnas are atypical with biased sequences, size variations in loops and stems, and absence of residues forming classical tertiary interactions, whereas synthetases appear typical. this raises questions about identity elements in mt-trnas and adaptation of their cognate mt-aarss. we have explored here the human mt-aspartate system in which a prokaryotic-type asprs, highly similar to the escherichia coli enzyme, recognizes a bizarre trna(asp). analysis of human mt-trna(asp) transcripts confirms the identity role of the guc anticodon as in other aspartylation systems but reveals the non-involvement of position 73. this position is otherwise known as the site of a universally conserved major aspartate identity element, g73, also known as a primordial identity signal. in mt-trna(asp), position 73 can be occupied by any of the four nucleotides without affecting aspartylation. sequence alignments of various asprss allowed placing gly-269 at a position occupied by asp-220, the residue contacting g73 in the crystallographic structure of e. coli asprs-trna(asp) complex. replacing this glycine by an aspartate renders human mt-asprs more discriminative to g73. restriction in the aspartylation identity set, driven by a rapid mutagenic rate of the mt-genome, suggests a reverse evolution of the mt-trna(asp) identity elements in regard to its bacterial ancestor.	@norel@
the role of late i and antiarrhythmic drugs in ead formation and termination in purkinje fibers. multiple components of cardiac na current play a role in determining electrical excitation in the heart. recently, the role of nonequilibrium components in controlling cardiac action potential plateau duration, and their importance in regulating the occurrence of afterdepolarizations and arrhythmias have garnered more attention. in particular, late na current (late i(na)) has been shown to be important in lqt2 and lqt3 arrhythmias. class iii agents like dofetilide, clofilium, and sotalol, which can all cause a drug-induced form of lqt2, significantly lengthen action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization in isolated rabbit purkinje fibers, and can initiate the formation of early afterdepolarizations, and extra beats. these actions can lead to the development of a serious ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, in animal models and patients. however, pretreatment with agents that block late i(na), like lidocaine, mexiletine, and rsd1235, a novel mixed ion channel blocker for the rapid pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation, significantly attenuates the prolonging effects of class iii agents or those induced by atx-ii, a specific toxin that delays na channel inactivation and amplifies late i(na) greatly, mimicking lqt3. the na channel block caused by lidocaine and rsd1235 can be through the open or inactivated states of the channel, but both equivalently inhibit a late component of na current (i(na)), recorded at 22 degrees c using whole-cell patch clamp of nav 1.5 expressed in hek cells. these protective actions of lidocaine, mexiletine, and rsd1235 may result, at least in part, from their ability to inhibit late i(na) during action potential repolarization, and inhibition of the inward currents contributing to ead and arrhythmia formation.	rsd1235 @chemical@ ion channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ lidocaine @chemical@ na channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ rsd1235 @chemical@ na channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
opioid activity profiles indicate similarities between the nociceptin/orphanin fq and opioid receptors. nociceptin (orphanin fq) is the recently discovered peptide agonist for the orphan receptor opioid receptor-like 1 (orl1). despite the high sequence homology between orl1 and the opioid receptors, most opioids lack affinity for the nociceptin receptor. the affinity and functional profile of opioids possessing activity at the nociceptin receptor was determined using [3h]nociceptin and nociceptin-stimulated [35s]gtpgammas binding. the mu-opioid receptor-selective agonist lofentanil potently and competitively displaced [3h]nociceptin at rat brain receptors (ic(50) 62 nm). lofentanil exhibited full agonism for enhancement of [35s]gtpgammas binding to human recombinant orl1 receptors (ec(50) 50 nm). the related piperidines ohmefentanyl and sufentanil and the nonselective opioid receptor agonist etorphine were less potent nociceptin receptor agonists. the kappa(1)+kappa(3)-opioid receptor agonist/mu-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone benzoylhydrazone was a pure antagonist at both rat brain and human orl1 receptors. the nonselective opioid receptor partial agonist buprenorphine and the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist (-)-quadazocine exhibited pure antagonism at rat brain receptors, but displayed partial agonism at human orl1 receptors. thus, opioids displaying full agonism at the nociceptin receptor are also opioid receptor agonists, whereas opioids that are antagonists or partial agonists at the nociceptin receptor show antagonism or partial agonism at opioid receptors. in addition, the stereospecificity required at opioid receptors appears to be retained at the nociceptin receptor, since (+)-quadazocine is inactive at both receptors. these findings illustrate the structural and functional homology of the opioid recognition site on these two receptor classes and suggest that opioids may provide leads for the design of nonpeptide nociceptin receptor agonists and antagonists lacking affinity for the classical opioid receptors.	lofentanil @chemical@ orl1 @gene@ @cpr:5@ sufentanil @chemical@ nociceptin receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ etorphine @chemical@ opioid receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ etorphine @chemical@ nociceptin receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ buprenorphine @chemical@ opioid receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ (-)-quadazocine @chemical@ human orl1 @gene@ @cpr:5@ lofentanil @chemical@ mu-opioid receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ piperidines @chemical@ nociceptin receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ ohmefentanyl @chemical@ nociceptin receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ naloxone benzoylhydrazone @chemical@ orl1 @gene@ @cpr:6@ naloxone benzoylhydrazone @chemical@ mu-opioid receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ (-)-quadazocine @chemical@ opioid receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
effects of orf 17583, other histamine h2-receptor antagonists and omeprazole on gastric acid secretory states in rats and dogs. orf 17583, a histamine h2-receptor antagonist, inhibited gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats (ed50 = 4.9 mg/kg intraduodenal; 3.4 mg/kg p.o.; and 0.21 mg/kg i.p.) and in total gastric fistula or heidenhain pouch dogs stimulated by betazole (ed50 = 0.12 mg/kg p.o. and 0.08 mg/kg i.v.), histamine, tetragastrin, bethanechol, 2-deoxy-d-glucose or a meal (ed50 values ranged from 0.11-0.26 mg/kg p.o.). the nonspecific inhibition of gastric acid by orf 17583 supports the existence of interdependence between histamine and the gastrin and cholinergic receptors on the parietal cell surface. antisecretory potency of orf 17583 after intraduodenal administration in pylorus-ligated rats was 6.4 times greater than cimetidine, 1.8 times greater than ranitidine, equal to that of omeprazole and 8 times less than that of famotidine. oral antisecretory potency of orf 17583 in gastric fistula dogs was 31 times greater than cimetidine, 3.7 times greater than ranitidine and equal to that of omeprazole and famotidine. studies using equieffective antisecretory doses of orf 17583 and ranitidine in dogs suggested that orf 17583 has a short duration of antisecretory activity similar to that of ranitidine.	orf 17583 @chemical@ histamine h2-receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ orf 17583 @chemical@ histamine h2-receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
neurochemical mechanism of action of anorectic drugs. studies with dexfenfluramine, an anorectic agent which releases 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) from nerve terminals and inhibits its reuptake, have considerably increased our knowledge of the role of 5-ht in feeding control. 5-ht1b receptors mediate the satiating effect of dexfenfluramine, whereas the mechanism by which 5-ht uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and sertraline cause anorexia is not clear. anorexia induced by (+)-amphetamine, phentermine, diethylpropion and phenylpropanolamine seems to be the result of their ability to increase the release of noradrenaline and/or dopamine from nerve terminals and inhibit their reuptake or, in the case of phenylpropanolamine, to stimulate directly alpha 1-adrenoceptors. it has been suggested that beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors and d1 dopamine receptors are involved in their effect on food intake. the difficulties of extrapolation across species limit our knowledge of the mechanism of the anorectic action in humans. significant advances in the treatment of feeding pathology will be linked to identifying new receptor types and subtypes for neurotransmitters and quantifying and modelling eating disorders such as binge-eating and food craving.	phenylpropanolamine @chemical@ alpha 1-adrenoceptors @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
antiaggressive activity of central oxytocin in male rats. rationale: a substantial body of research suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin promotes social affiliative behaviors in a wide range of animals including humans. however, its antiaggressive action has not been unequivocally demonstrated in male laboratory rodents. objective: our primary goal was to examine the putative serenic effect of oxytocin in a feral strain (wild type groningen, wtg) of rats that generally show a much broader variation and higher levels of intermale aggression than commonly used laboratory strains of rats. methods: resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain oxytocin functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder. results: our data clearly demonstrate that acute icv administered oxytocin produces dose-dependent and receptor-selective changes in social behavior, reducing aggression and potentiating social exploration. these antiaggressive effects are stronger in the more offensive rats. on the other hand, administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist tends to increase (nonsignificantly) aggression only in low-medium aggressive animals. conclusions: these results suggest that transiently enhancing brain oxytocin function has potent antiaggressive effects, whereas its attenuation tends to enhance aggressiveness. in addition, a possible inverse relationship between trait aggression and endogenous oxytocinergic signaling is revealed. overall, this study emphasizes the importance of brain oxytocinergic signaling for regulating intermale offensive aggression. this study supports the suggestion that oxytocin receptor agonists could clinically be useful for curbing heightened aggression seen in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders like antisocial personality disorder, autism, and addiction.	@norel@
adolescence methylphenidate treatment in a rodent model of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: dopamine transporter function and cellular distribution in adulthood. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is attributed to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. methylphenidate, an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (dat and net, respectively), is a standard treatment for adhd. the spontaneously hypertensive rat (shr) is a well-established animal model of adhd. our previous results showed that methylphenidate treatment in adolescent shr enhanced cocaine self-administration during adulthood, and alterations in dat function in prefrontal cortex play a role in this response. importantly, prefrontal cortex subregions, orbitofrontal cortex (ofc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc), have been shown to have distinct roles in adhd and cocaine self-administration. in the current study, shr, wistar-kyoto (wky) and wistar (wis) rats received a therapeutically relevant dose of methylphenidate (1.5mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle during adolescence and then ofc and mpfc dat function and cellular expression were assessed during adulthood. in both ofc and mpfc, no strain differences in vmax or km for dopamine uptake into synaptosomes were found between vehicle-treated shr, wky and wis. methylphenidate increased dat vmax in shr mpfc and decreased dat vmax in wky ofc. also, methylphenidate decreased dat km in wis ofc. further, methylphenidate did not alter dat cellular localization, indicating that methylphenidate treatment during adolescence regulated dat function in shr mpfc in a trafficking-independent manner. thus, the increase in mpfc dat function was an shr-specific long term consequence of methylphenidate treatment during adolescence, which may be responsible for the treatment-induced alterations in behavior including the observed increases in cocaine self-administration.	methylphenidate @chemical@ dat @gene@ @cpr:3@ methylphenidate @chemical@ dat @gene@ @cpr:3@ methylphenidate @chemical@ dopamine and norepinephrine transporters @gene@ @cpr:4@ methylphenidate @chemical@ dat @gene@ @cpr:4@ methylphenidate @chemical@ net @gene@ @cpr:4@ methylphenidate @chemical@ dat @gene@ @cpr:4@ methylphenidate @chemical@ dat @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
biosynthesis, assembly and secretion of coagulation factor viii. factor viii is a large complex glycoprotein that is deficient in hemophilia a. it has a domain organization consisting of a1-a2-b-a3-c1-c2 where the b domain is a heavily glycosylated region that is dispensable for procoagulant activity. factor viii expression is 10-to 20-fold lower than the homologous coagulation factor v. factor viii expression is limited due to a low level of steady-state messenger rna in the cytoplasm and inefficient transport of the primary translation product from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus. within the secretory pathway, factor viii is processed to a heterodimer of the heavy chain (domains a1-a2-b) in a metal ion association with the light chain (domains a3-c1-c2). upon secretion from the cell, von willebrand factor binds the light chain of factor viii and stabilizes the factor, preventing degradation. protein folding within the mammalian secretory pathway is facilitated by molecular chaperones. within the endoplasmic reticulum, factor viii exhibits stable interaction with protein chaperones identified as the immunoglobulin-binding protein (bip), calnexin and calreticulin. bip is a peptide-dependent atpase that interacts with exposed hydrophobic surfaces on unfolded proteins or unassembled protein subunits. a potential bip binding site within factor viii has been identified. mutation of a single amino acid residue in the potential bip binding site increased the secretion efficiency of factor viii by threefold. interestingly, the proposed bip binding site is adjacent to a type-1 copper binding site within the a1 domain that is required for interaction between the factor viii a1 domain and the a3 domain. we propose that cu(i) binds the type-1 copper ion-binding site in the a1 domain and provides the essential requirement for a stable interaction between the heavy and light chains. calnexin and calreticulin are transmembrane and lumenal proteins, respectively, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which associate transiently with many soluble and membrane glycoproteins during folding and subunit assembly. the calnexin and calreticulin interaction with factor viii occurs primarily through amino-terminal linked oligosaccharides within the heavily glycosylated factor viii b domain and this interaction appears to be required for factor viii secretion. the findings suggest that factor viii cycles through interactions with bip, calnexin and calreticulin. although the interaction with bip does not appear to be required for factor viii secretion, data suggest that the calnexin and/or calreticulin interaction is required for secretion. the observations suggest a unique requirement for carbohydrate processing and calnexin/calreticulin interaction that may limit the productive secretion of factor viii and have implications for approaches towards somatic cell gene therapy for hemophilia a.	@norel@
activator of g protein signaling 3 regulates opiate activation of protein kinase a signaling and relapse of heroin-seeking behavior. the nucleus accumbens (nac) is central to heroin addiction. activation of opiate receptors in the nac dissociates g(i/o) into alpha and betagamma subunits. galpha(i) inhibits camp production, but betagamma regulates several molecular pathways, including protein kinase a (pka). we show in nac/striatal neurons that opiates paradoxically activate pka signaling by means of betagamma dimers. activation requires galpha(i3) and an activator of g protein signaling 3 (ags3). ags3 competes with betagamma for binding to galpha(i3)-gdp and enhances the action of unbound betagamma. ags3 and galpha(i3) knockdown prevents opiate activation of pka signaling. in rats self-administering heroin, ags3 antisense in the nac core, but not shell, eliminates reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior, a model of human relapse. thus, galpha(i3)/betagamma/ags3 appears to mediate mu opiate receptor activation of pka signaling as well as heroin-seeking behavior.	@norel@
abca1 single nucleotide polymorphisms on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and overweight: the d.e.s.i.r. study. the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette a1 (abca1) gene plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport. some abca1 gene polymorphisms have been associated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) concentrations. the aim of this study was to assess the effect of three polymorphisms, c69t, g378c, and g1051a (r219k), on hdl-c levels and their interaction with bmi in more than 5000 french whites from the d.e.s.i.r. (data from an epidemiological study on the insulin resistance syndrome) cohort study. the t allele of the c69t single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) was associated with higher hdl-c levels in normal-weight men (bmi <25 kg/m(2)). the c allele of the g378c snp was associated with lower hdl-c in overweight subjects (bmi > or =25 kg/m(2)). for the g1051a snp, in the normal-weight group, the minor a allele was significantly associated with higher hdl-c levels. in contrast, in overweight people, the minor allele was associated with lower hdl-c levels. after accounting for multiple testing, empiric p values remained significant for the associations between g378c snp and hdl-c in the overweight group and between g1051a snp and hdl-c in the normal-weight group. this study suggests that abca1 gene polymorphisms modulate hdl-c concentrations, in interaction with bmi, and, thus, they might influence cardiovascular risk in the general population.	@norel@
gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene expression during pubertal development of male rats. appropriate expression of the gnrh receptor (gnrh-r) in gonadotropes is critical for gnrh signaling and hence for gonadotropin secretion and sexual development. in the present work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state gnrh-r mrna levels in pituitaries of male rats from day 5 to day 55, when sexual maturity is attained. developmental changes of gonadotropin subunit (alpha, fshbeta, and lhbeta) mrna levels were also assessed. in addition, the role of the endogenous gnrh on the maturational changes of gnrh-r and gonadotropin subunit gene expression was investigated. messenger rna levels were determined by northern blot analysis of total rna from anterior pituitaries. amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kb) gnrh-r mrna increased slowly from day 5 through the infantile and the juvenile periods, to peak at day 35 (12-fold increase vs. day 5). thereafter, the levels of the gnrh-r mrna decline slightly until day 55 (33% decrease vs. day 35). parallel changes were observed on the 4.5-kb transcript of the gnrh-r gene. alpha subunit mrna was easily detected at day 5, and its levels increased progressively through the infantile period (2.5-fold increase) and peaked at day 25 (3.3-fold increase vs. day 5) with a smooth nonstatistically significant increment until day 35; then it decreased by 41.5% at day 55. fshbeta and lhbeta mrna levels rose slowly until day 25. a sharp rise occurred thereafter to reach maximum levels at day 35 (5.8-fold for fshbeta and 3.8-fold for lhbeta vs. day 25). thereafter, the levels of both mrnas fell until day 55 (44.1% decrease for fshbeta and 37.1% decrease for lhbeta vs. day 35). to ascertain whether developmental activation of the gnrh-r and gonadotropin subunit gene expression is gnrh dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the endogenous gnrh action by treating developing male rats with the specific gnrh antagonist cetrorelix (1.5 mg/kg body weight/week, s.c.) through the infantile (days 5-20) and the juvenile periods (days 20-35). cetrorelix completely blocked the rise of levels of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of the gnrh-r mrna, during both the infantile and the juvenile periods. cetrorelix also abolished the developmental rise of the gonadotropin beta subunit mrnas during the two periods of the study. in contrast, the alpha subunit gene expression was not altered by cetrorelix treatment during any of the two periods. these data demonstrate that sexual maturation of male rats is accompanied by a progressive and concerted induction of gnrh-r and gonadotropin subunit gene expression. developmental activation of gnrh-r and gonadotropin beta subunit genes is gnrh dependent. the apparent gnrh-independent regulation of the alpha-glycoprotein subunit mrna levels may be due to the contribution of thyrotropes and perhaps to the presence of exclusive regulatory signals for this gene.	cetrorelix @chemical@ gnrh-r @gene@ @cpr:4@ cetrorelix @chemical@ gonadotropin beta @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
novel analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents: 1,5-diarylpyrrole nitrooxyalkyl ethers and related compounds as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibiting nitric oxide donors. a series of 3-substituted 1,5-diarylpyrroles bearing a nitrooxyalkyl side chain linked to different spacers were designed. new classes of pyrrole-derived nitrooxyalkyl inverse esters, carbonates, and ethers (7-10) as cox-2 selective inhibitors and no donors were synthesized and are herein reported. by taking into account the metabolic conversion of nitrooxyalkyl ethers (9, 10) into corresponding alcohols, derivatives 17 and 18 were also studied. nitrooxy derivatives showed no-dependent vasorelaxing properties, while most of the compounds proved to be very potent and selective cox-2 inhibitors in in vitro experimental models. further in vivo studies on compounds 9a,c and 17a highlighted good anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. compound 9c was able to inhibit glycosaminoglycan (gag) release induced by interleukin-1β (il-1β), showing cartilage protective properties. finally, molecular modeling and (1)h- and (13)c-nmr studies performed on compounds 6c,d, 9c, and 10b allowed the right conformation of nitrooxyalkyl ester and ether side chain of these molecules within the cox-2 active site to be assessed.	nitrooxy @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ nitric oxide @chemical@ cyclooxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 1,5-diarylpyrrole nitrooxyalkyl ethers @chemical@ cyclooxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pyrrole @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ nitrooxyalkyl @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ esters @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ carbonates @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ethers @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
binding between heparin and the integrin vla-4. heparin possesses antimetastatic effects that were related to various molecular mechanisms beyond anticoagulant activities. the ability of heparin to interfere with the function of adhesion receptors in the metastatic course appears as a promising therapeutic approach. this refers to numerous findings that heparin attenuates metastasis in a selectin-dependent manner. we recently demonstrated that heparin interferes with the integrin vla-4 on murine melanoma cells binding to vcam-1. to confirm this activity and to obtain further insight into molecular recognition of heparin by vla-4, we investigated the inhibition of vla-4 mediated binding of human melanoma mv3 cells to immobilised vcam-1 by different heparins. the size of heparin has an important impact on inhibition. unfractionated heparin (ufh) and tinzaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (lmwh) representing a mean of about 18-20 monomers, displayed high inhibitory activity. fractionating tinzaparin to 14-18 monomers reduced inhibition slightly, while the pentasaccharide fondaparinux was without effects. to confirm molecular recognition of tinzaparin by vla-4, a surface acoustic wave-biosensor was applied. a vla-4 containing membrane preparation of mv3 cells was immobilised at the sensors to allow for detection of kinetic binding constants of tinzaparin compared to vcam-1. tinzaparin binds to vla-4 with affinity in the low micromolar range (4.61 x 10(-6) m), which clearly indicates specific molecular recognition. furthermore, tinzaparin displays a nearly identical k(off) compared to vcam-1 (5.13 x 10(-3) s(-1) versus 3.44 x 10(-3) s(-1)) which is evident for interference with the ligand binding. the data provide evidence for a direct confirmation of heparin binding to vla-4 and thus, contribute to understand the antimetastatic activity of heparin.	@norel@
nuclear diacylglycerol kinase-theta is activated in response to alpha-thrombin. currently, there is substantial evidence that nuclear lipid metabolism plays a critical role in a number of signal transduction cascades. previous work from our laboratory showed that stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts with alpha-thrombin leads to the production of two lipid second messengers in the nucleus: an increase in nuclear diacylglycerol mass and an activation of phospholipase d, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid. diacylglycerol kinase (dgk) catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, making it an attractive candidate for a signal transduction component. there is substantial evidence that this activity is indeed regulated in a number of signaling cascades (reviewed by van blitterswijk, w. j., and houssa, b. (1999) chem. phys. lipids 98, 95-108). in this report, we show that the addition of alpha-thrombin to quiescent iic9 fibroblasts results in an increase in nuclear dgk activity. the examination of nuclei isolated from quiescent iic9 cells indicates that dgk-theta and dgk-delta are both present. we took advantage of the previous observations that phosphatidylserine inhibits dgk-delta (reviewed by sakane, f., imai, s., kai, m., wada, i., and kanoh, h. (1996) j. biol. chem. 271, 8394-8401), and constitutively active rhoa inhibits dgk-theta (reviewed by houssa, b., de widt, j., kranenburg, o., moolenaar, w. h., and van blitterswijk, w. j. (1999) j. biol. chem. 274, 6820-6822) to identify the activity induced by alpha-thrombin. constitutively active rhoa inhibited the nuclear stimulated activity, whereas phosphatidylserine did not have an inhibitory effect. in addition, a monoclonal anti-dgk-theta antibody inhibited the alpha-thrombin-stimulated nuclear activity in vitro. these results demonstrate that dgk-theta is the isoform responsive to alpha-thrombin stimulation. western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses showed that alpha-thrombin induced the translocation of dgk-theta to the nucleus, implicating that this translocation is at least partly responsible for the increased nuclear activity. taken together, these data are the first to demonstrate an agonist-induced activity of nuclear dgk-theta activity and a nuclear localization of dgk-delta.	phosphatidylserine @chemical@ dgk-delta @gene@ @cpr:4@ phosphatidic acid @chemical@ diacylglycerol kinase @gene@ @cpr:9@ phosphatidic acid @chemical@ dgk @gene@ @cpr:9@ diacylglycerol @chemical@ diacylglycerol kinase @gene@ @cpr:9@ diacylglycerol @chemical@ dgk @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
inhibition of monoamine oxidase by phthalide analogues. based on recent reports that the small molecules, isatin and phthalimide, are suitable scaffolds for the design of high potency monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors, the present study examines the mao inhibitory properties of a series of phthalide [2-benzofuran-1(3h)-one] analogues. phthalide is structurally related to isatin and phthalimide and it is demonstrated here that substitution at c6 of the phthalide moiety yields compounds endowed with high binding affinities to both human mao isoforms. among the nineteen homologues evaluated, the lowest ic(50) values recorded for the inhibition of mao-a and -b were 0.096 and 0.0014 μm, respectively. in most instances, c6-substituted phthalides exhibit mao-b specific inhibition. among a series of 6-benzyloxyphthalides bearing substituents on the para position of the phenyl ring the general order of potency was cf(3) > i > br > cl > f > ch(3) > h. the results also show that the binding modes of representative phthalides are reversible and competitive at both mao isoforms. based on these data, c6-substituted phthalides may serve as leads for the development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson's disease.	isatin @chemical@ monoamine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ isatin @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ phthalimide @chemical@ monoamine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ phthalimide @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ phthalides @chemical@ mao-b @gene@ @cpr:4@ phthalides @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ phthalide @chemical@ monoamine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ phthalide @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ 2-benzofuran-1(3h)-one @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
neuropeptide y y1 receptor knockdown can modify glutathione peroxidase and c-amp response element-binding protein in phenylpropanolamine-treated rats. it has been reported that antioxidative enzymes, neuropeptide y (npy), and c-amp response element-binding protein (creb) are involved in regulating phenylpropanolamine (ppa)-mediated appetite suppression. here, we investigated whether y1 receptor (y1r) might be involved in this regulation. rats were daily treated with ppa for 4 days. changes in the contents of npy, y1r, glutathione peroxidase (gp), and creb were assessed and compared. results showed that y1r, gp, and creb increased, with a maximal increase about 100, 200, and 150 %, respectively, on day 2. by contrast, npy decreased with a biggest reduction about 48 % on day 2 and the pattern of expression during ppa treatment was opposite to those of y1r, gp, and creb. central knockdown (using antisense) or inhibition (using antagonist) of y1r expression modulated the anorectic response of ppa and the reciprocal regulation between npy and gp (or creb), revealing an essential role of y1r in regulating npy, gp, and creb. these results suggest that y1r participates in the reciprocal regulation of npy, gp, and creb in the hypothalamus during ppa treatment in conscious rats. the present results may aid the therapeutic research of ppa and related antiobesity drugs.	@norel@
zuclopenthixol facilitates memory retrieval in rats: possible involvement of noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms. although disturbed memory function often coexists with psychosis, the cognitive effects of antipsychotic medications with diverse pharmacodynamic properties are rarely investigated. the neurocognitive profile of zuclopenthixol, a thioxanthene dopaminergic antagonist and a conventional neuroleptic agent, has yet to be investigated despite the effect of the drug on a variety of neurotransmitter systems involved in mediation of learning and memory processes. in this study, the effect of zuclopenthixol was tested on memory retrieval 24 h after training using an inhibitory avoidance task in rats. acute administration of zuclopenthixol (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) before retrieval testing increased step-through latency during the test session. the same doses of zuclopenthixol did not affect the ambulatory activity of rats in the openfield test and therefore the facilitatory effect of the drug on memory function could not be confounded with any motoric properties. this study also investigated the effect of zuclopenthixol on cortical and hippocampal monoaminergic neurotransmitters' levels together with acetylcholinesterase enzyme (ache) activity, both of which are known to be important in control of cognitive function. administration of zuclopenthixol (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) neither affected dopamine (da) level nor ache activity in rat cortex and hippocampus. on the other hand, the lower dose of zuclopenthixol elevated cortical norepinephrine (ne) level, while the higher dose elevated both cortical and hippocampal ne level together with hippocampal serotonin (5-ht) level. these results may suggest the involvement of adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the facilitatory effect of zuclopenthixol on retrieval memory. zuclopenthixol may therefore be a better alternative than other commonly used antipsychotic medications reported to impair cognitive function of schizophrenic patients.	@norel@
hydrophobic amino acids in the hinge region of the 5a apolipoprotein mimetic peptide are essential for promoting cholesterol efflux by the abca1 transporter. the bihelical apolipoprotein mimetic peptide 5a effluxes cholesterol from cells and reduces inflammation and atherosclerosis in animal models. we investigated how hydrophobic residues in the hinge region between the two helices are important in the structure and function of this peptide. by simulated annealing analysis and molecular dynamics modeling, two hydrophobic amino acids, f-18 and w-21, in the hinge region were predicted to be relatively surface-exposed and to interact with the aqueous solvent. using a series of 5a peptide analogs in which f-18 or w-21 was changed to either f, w, a, or e, only peptides with hydrophobic amino acids in these two positions were able to readily bind and solubilize phospholipid vesicles. compared with active peptides containing f or w, peptides containing e in either of these two positions were more than 10-fold less effective in effluxing cholesterol by the abca1 transporter. intravenous injection of 5a in c57bl/6 mice increased plasma-free cholesterol (5a: 89.9 ± 13.6 mg/dl; control: 38.7 ± 4.3 mg/dl (mean ± s.d.); p < 0.05) and triglycerides (5a: 887.0 ± 172.0 mg/dl; control: 108.9 ± 9.9 mg/dl; p < 0.05), whereas the ee peptide containing e in both positions had no effect. finally, 5a increased cholesterol efflux approximately 2.5-fold in vivo from radiolabeled macrophages, whereas the ee peptide was inactive. these results provide a rationale for future design of therapeutic apolipoprotein mimetic peptides and provide new insights into the interaction of hydrophobic residues on apolipoproteins with phospholipids in the lipid microdomain created by the abca1 transporter during the cholesterol efflux process.	cholesterol @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ apolipoprotein mimetic peptide 5a @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
thyroid hormone receptor expression in the obligatory paedomorphic salamander necturus maculosus. amphibian metamorphosis is under the strict control of thyroid hormones (th). these hormones induce metamorphosis by controlling gene expression through binding to thyroid hormone receptors (trs). necturus maculosus is considered to be an obligatory paedomorphic amphibian since metamorphosis never occurs spontaneously and cannot be induced by pharmacological means. since metamorphosis depends on the acquisition of response of tadpole tissues to thyroid hormone, we aimed to determine tr gene expression patterns in necturus maculosus as well as the expression of two th-related genes: cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein (cthbp)-m2-pyruvate kinase, a gene encoding a cytosolic th binding protein and stromelysin 3, a direct th target gene in xenopus laevis. tissue samples were obtained from specimens of necturus maculosus. we performed in situ hybridization using non-cross-hybridizing rna probes obtained from the cloned necturus tralpha and trbeta genes. we found clear expression of necturus tralpha gene in several tissues including the central nervous system, epithelial cells of digestive and urinary organs, as well as myocardium and skeletal muscle. trbeta was also expressed in the brain. in other tissues, hybridization signals were too low to draw reliable conclusions about their precise distribution. in addition, we observed that the expression of cthbp and st3 is largely distinct from that of trs. the fact that we observed a clear expression of tralpha and trbeta which are evolutionary conserved, suggests that necturus tissues express trs. our results thus indicate that, in contrast to previously held hypotheses, necturus tissues are th responsive.	@norel@
reelin down-regulation in mice and psychosis endophenotypes. reelin, a large glycoprotein secreted by telencephalic gabaergic neurons, plays an important role in neuronal guidance embryonically and in synaptic plasticity postnatally. the reeler heterozygous mouse (+/rl) appears superficially normal but has been of interest as an animal model for psychosis since the discovery that reelin is 50% down-regulated in postmortem psychotic brain. brain abnormalities in +/rl are similar to psychotic brain and include a reduction in glutamic acid de carboxylase 67 (gad67), dendritic arbors and spine density in cortex and hippocampus, and abnormalities in synaptic function including long-term potentiation (ltp). in spite of these abnormalities, behavioral abnormalities in +/rl are subtle and controversial. recent findings indicate that the reelin (reln) and gad67 promoters are hypermethylated in gabaergic neurons of psychotic postmortem brain and that dna methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) is up-regulated. hypermethlyation of reln and gad67 promoters can be induced by treating mice with methionine, and these mice display brain and behavioral abnormalities similar to +/rl. thus, an animal model that combines genetic heterozygocity with epigenesis holds promise for understanding the role of reelin down-regulation in psychosis.	methionine @chemical@ reln and gad67 promoters @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. dna cloning, characterization, and inhibition studies of the human secretory isoform vi, a new target for sulfonamide and sulfamate inhibitors. the secretory isozyme of human carbonic anhydrase (hca, ec 4.2.1.1), hca vi, has been cloned, expressed, and purified in a bacterial expression system. the kinetic parameters for the co2 hydration reaction proved hca vi to possess a kcat of 3.4 x 10(5) s-1 and kcat/km of 4.9 x 10(7) m-1 s-1 (at ph 7.5 and 20 degrees c). hca vi has a significant catalytic activity for the physiological reaction on the same order of magnitude as the ubiquitous isoform ca i or the transmembrane, tumor-associated isozyme ca ix. a series of sulfonamides and one sulfamate have been tested for their interaction with this isozyme. simple benzenesulfonamides were rather ineffective hca vi inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range of 1090-6680 nm. better inhibitors were detected among such derivatives bearing 2- or 4-amino-, 4-aminomethyl-, or 4-hydroxymethyl moieties or among halogenated sulfanilamides (ki values of 608-955 nm). some clinically used compounds, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dichlorophenamide, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, topiramate, sulpiride, and indisulam, or the orphan drug benzolamide, showed effective hca vi inhibitory activity, with inhibition constants of 0.8-79 nm. the best inhibitors were brinzolamide and sulpiride (ki values of 0.8-0.9 nm), the latter compound being also a ca vi-selective inhibitor. the metallic taste reported as a side effect after the treatment with systemic sulfonamides may be due to the inhibition of the salivary ca vi. some of the compounds investigated in this study might be used as additives in toothpastes for reducing the acidification produced by the relevant co2 hydrase activity of enamel ca vi, which leads to the formation of protons and bicarbonate and may have a role in cariogenesis.	sulfonamides @chemical@ salivary ca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ dichlorophenamide @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ methazolamide @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ ethoxzolamide @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulfonamide @chemical@ human secretory isoform vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulfamate @chemical@ human secretory isoform vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ dorzolamide @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ brinzolamide @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ topiramate @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulpiride @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ indisulam @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ benzolamide @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ brinzolamide @chemical@ ca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulpiride @chemical@ ca vi @gene@ @cpr:4@ co2 @chemical@ ca vi @gene@ @cpr:9@ bicarbonate @chemical@ ca vi @gene@ @cpr:9@ co2 @chemical@ hca vi @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
iron and zinc bioavailability in caco-2 cells: influence of caseinophosphopeptides. a study has been made of the influence of two pools of caseinophosphopeptides (cpps) obtained from α(s)- and β-casein (cn) fractions, and of three specific cpps (β-cn(1-25)4p, α(s1)-cn(64-74)4p and α(s2)-cn(1-19)4p), on iron bioavailability (ferritin synthesis) and zinc bioavailability (retention, transport and uptake of zinc) in caco-2 cells. α-cpp and β-cpp pools did not improve ferritin synthesis, but the three specific cpps showed an increase in ferritin synthesis in caco-2 cells versus iron sulphate, β-cn(1-25)4p being the most effective. in relation to zinc bioavailability, α-cpps, β-cpps, α(s1)-cn(64-74)4p and β-cn(1-25)4p increased zinc uptake. however, this increase was of the same order as the increase due to the presence of zinc sulphate.	zinc @chemical@ α-cpps @gene@ @cpr:9@ zinc @chemical@ β-cpps @gene@ @cpr:9@ zinc @chemical@ α(s1)-cn @gene@ @cpr:9@ zinc @chemical@ β-cn @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
transcriptome alterations following developmental atrazine exposure in zebrafish are associated with disruption of neuroendocrine and reproductive system function, cell cycle, and carcinogenesis. atrazine, a herbicide commonly applied to agricultural areas and a common contaminant of potable water supplies, is implicated as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (edc) and potential carcinogen. studies show that edcs can cause irreversible changes in tissue formation, decreased reproductive potential, obesity, and cancer. the u.s. environmental protection agency considers an atrazine concentration of ≤ 3 ppb in drinking water safe for consumption. the specific adverse human health effects associated with a developmental atrazine exposure and the underlying genetic mechanisms of these effects are not well defined. in this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations to establish toxicity. morphological, transcriptomic, and protein alterations were then assessed at 72h postfertilization following developmental atrazine exposure at 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb. a significant increase in head length was observed in all three atrazine treatments. transcriptomic profiles revealed 21, 62, and 64 genes with altered expression in the 0.3, 3, and 30 ppb atrazine treatments, respectively. altered genes were associated with neuroendocrine and reproductive system development, function, and disease; cell cycle control; and carcinogenesis. there was a significant overlap (42 genes) between the 3 and 30 ppb differentially expressed gene lists, with two of these genes (cyp17a1 and samhd1) present in all three atrazine treatments. increased transcript levels were translated to significant upregulation in protein expression. overall, this study identifies genetic and molecular targets altered in response to a developmental atrazine exposure to further define the biological pathways and mechanisms of toxicity.	@norel@
temporal profile of brain and pituitary gnrhs, gnrh-r and gonadotropin mrna expression and content during early development in european sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax l.). a likely endocrine control mechanism for sexual differentiation in size-graded populations of european sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax) is proposed by evaluating the brain expression and pituitary content of two forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh), namely sea bream (sbgnrh) and salmon (sgnrh), the pituitary expression of one subtype of gnrh receptor (dlgnrh-r-2a) and the three gonadotropin (gth) subunits, namely glycoprotein alpha (gpalpha), follicle-stimulating hormone beta (fshbeta) and luteinizing hormone beta (lhbeta), as well as the pituitary and plasma lh levels between 50 and 300 days post-hatching (dph). four gradings were conducted between 2 and 8 months after hatching, resulting in a population of large and small individuals, having 96.5% females (female-dominant population) and 69.2% males (male-dominant population), respectively, after the last grading. the onset of gonadal differentiation was different in the two sexes, and coincided with a peak of expression of sbgnrh or sgnrh. furthermore, the expression of these gnrhs was correlated with the expression of dlgnrh-r-2a. sex-related differences in the brain and pituitary content of sbgnrh were also found at the time of sexual differentiation. moreover, the observed sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional or synthesis level of these gnrh forms suggests that a different neuro-hormonal regulation is operating according to sex. at the onset of sex differentiation, fshbeta transcriptional activity reached maximal values, which were maintained until the completion of the process. the present study suggests a role for sbgnrh, sgnrh and the dlgnrh-r-2a during gonadal differentiation, possibly through enhancement of fshbeta gene expression. in males, a different endocrine regulation seems to exist also during spermiogenesis and spermiation, when gene transcription, peptide synthesis and release of lh are of greater importance.	@norel@
iron overload inhibits osteoblast biological activity through oxidative stress. iron overload has recently been connected with bone mineral density in osteoporosis. however, to date, the effect of iron overload on osteoblasts remains poorly understood. the purpose of this study is to examine osteoblast biological activity under iron overload. the osteoblast cells (hfob1.19) were cultured in a medium supplemented with different concentrations (50, 100, and 200 μm) of ferric ammonium citrate as a donor of ferric ion. intracellular iron was measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope. reactive oxygen species (ros) were detected by 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorophotometry. osteoblast biological activities were evaluated by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase (alp) and mineralization function. results indicated that iron overload could consequently increase intracellular iron concentration and intracellular ros levels in a concentration-dependent manner. additionally, alp activity was suppressed, and a decline in the number of mineralized nodules was observed in in vitro cultured osteoblast cells. according to these results, it seems that iron overload probably inhibits osteoblast function through higher oxidative stress following increased intracellular iron concentrations.	@norel@
identification of aldo-keto reductases as nrf2-target marker genes in human cells. transcription factor nf-e2-related factor 2 (nrf2) plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress by up-regulating multiple antioxidant genes. numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human nrf2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of nrf2 may allow the monitoring of nrf2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. for this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by nrf2 to establish markers for nrf2 activity in human cells. firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial hk-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported nrf2 target genes in response to nrf2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (akr) 1c1 is highly inducible by all treatments. accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of akrs were significantly attenuated in nrf2-silenced hk-2 cells. whereas, cells with stable keap1 knockdown, which causes a modest nrf2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of akr1a1, 1b1, 1b10, 1c1, 1c2, and 1c3. secondly, the linkage between nrf2 and the akrs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line u937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. the treatment of u937 cells with nrf2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of akr1b1, 1b10, 1c1, 1c2, and 1c3. whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of akr1c1 were significantly reduced in nrf2-silenced stable u937 cells compared to the control cells. similarly, the inducible expression of akr1c1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line thp-1 as well as in human primary blood cd14(+) monocytes. in conclusion, together with the high inducibility and nrf2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that akrs can be utilized as a marker of nrf2 activity in human cells.	sulforaphane @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sulforaphane @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tert-butylhydroquinone @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tert-butylhydroquinone @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cinnamic aldehyde @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cinnamic aldehyde @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ hydrogen peroxide @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ hydrogen peroxide @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sulforaphane @chemical@ nrf2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sulforaphane @chemical@ aldo-keto reductase (akr) 1c1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tert-butylhydroquinone @chemical@ aldo-keto reductase (akr) 1c1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cinnamic aldehyde @chemical@ aldo-keto reductase (akr) 1c1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ hydrogen peroxide @chemical@ aldo-keto reductase (akr) 1c1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sulforaphane @chemical@ akr1b1, 1b10, 1c1, 1c2, and 1c3 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sulforaphane @chemical@ akr1c1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
pranlukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, inhibits interleukin-5 production via a mechanism distinct from leukotriene receptor antagonism. background: pranlukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (cysltr1) antagonist, inhibits not only airway smooth muscle contraction, but also allergic inflammation. the aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of pranlukast-induced interleukin-5 (il-5) inhibition in allergic inflammation. methods: surgically resected human lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with mite-allergen-sensitized sera, followed by stimulation with mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with pranlukast, dexamethasone, or both. the il-5 protein level in the culture medium was measured, and in situ hybridization of il-5 and cysltr1 mrna was performed using lung tissues. results: pretreatment of lung tissues with pranlukast alone significantly decreased the amount of il-5 protein in the culture medium by 40%. the combination of pranlukast and dexamethasone synergistically enhanced this effect. quantitative in situ hybridization with image analysis revealed abundant expression of il-5 mrna in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues. cysltr1 mrna was detected in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, but was less expressed in lymphocytes. pranlukast-induced inhibition of il-5 mrna expression was noted in various cells, irrespective of their cysltr1 mrna expression status. in addition, cysteinyl leukotrienes per se failed to upregulate the il-5 production. conclusion: our results indicate that pranlukast inhibits il-5 synthesis via a mechanism distinct from cysltr1 antagonism.	pranlukast @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pranlukast @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pranlukast @chemical@ interleukin-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pranlukast @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pranlukast @chemical@ interleukin-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pranlukast @chemical@ il-5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pranlukast @chemical@ leukotriene receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ pranlukast @chemical@ leukotriene receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ pranlukast @chemical@ cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 @gene@ @cpr:6@ pranlukast @chemical@ cysltr1 @gene@ @cpr:6@ pranlukast @chemical@ cysltr1 @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
astemizole, a potent histamine h1-receptor antagonist: effect in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, on antigen and histamine induced skin weal responses and relationship to serum levels. the efficacy of astemizole, a new, long acting, oral histamine h1-receptor antagonist was compared to placebo for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis during the grass pollen season of 1982. sixty-three patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and current symptoms participated in an 8 week, double-blind, randomized study. astemizole, 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (p less than 0.05) and eye (p less than 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve medication, clemastine, by the placebo group (p less than 0.003). there was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit became manifest. subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (p less than 0.05) and runny nose (p less than 0.05) but not blocked nose. the absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography. the antihistaminic potency of astemizole was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the histamine induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy. a positive correlation was found between serum drug levels and % inhibition of histamine skin weal (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). astemizole was free from adverse sedative or anticholinergic effects but did cause a mean increase in weight of 1.3 kg (p less than 0.01) after 8 weeks therapy, not found with placebo.	astemizole @chemical@ histamine h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ astemizole @chemical@ histamine h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
analysis of alpha 1l-adrenoceptor pharmacology in rat small mesenteric artery. 1. to illuminate the controversy on alpha 1a- or alpha 1l-adrenoceptor involvement in noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat small mesenteric artery (sma), we have studied the effects of subtype-selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists under different experimental conditions. 2. the agonist potency order in rat sma was: a61603 >> skf89748-a > cirazoline > noradrenaline > st-587 > methoxamine. prazosin antagonized all agonists with a low potency (pa2: 8.29-8.80) indicating the involvement of alpha 1l-rather than alpha 1a-adrenoceptors. 3. the putative alpha 1l-adrenoceptor antagonist jth-601, but not the alpha 1b-adrenoceptor antagonist chloroethylclonidine (10 microm) antagonized noradrenaline-induced contractions of sma. the potency of the selective alpha 1d-adrenoceptor antagonist bmy 7378 against noradrenaline (pa2 = 6.16 +/- 0.13) and of the selective alpha 1a-adrenoceptor antagonist rs-17053 against noradrenaline (pkb = 8.35 +/- 0.10) and against the selective alpha 1a-adrenoceptor agonist a-61603 (pkb = 8.40 +/- 0.09) were too low to account for alpha 1d- and alpha 1a-adrenoceptor involvement. 4. the potency of rs-17053 (pkb/pa2's = 7.72-8.46) was not affected by lowering temperature, changing experimental protocol or inducing myogenic tone via kcl or u46619. 5. selective protection of a putative alpha 1a-adrenoceptor population against the irreversible action of phenoxybenzamine also failed to increase the potency of rs-17053 (pa2 = 8.25 +/- 0.06 against a61603). 6. combined concentration-ratio analysis demonstrated that tamsulosin, which does not discriminate between alpha 1a- and alpha 1l-adrenoceptors, and rs-17053 competed for binding at the same site in the sma. 7. in summary, data obtained in our experiments in rat sma indicate that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contraction displays a distinct alpha 1l-adrenoceptor pharmacology. this study does not provide evidence for the hypothesis that alpha 1l-adrenoceptors represent an affinity state of the alpha 1a-adrenoceptor in functional assays. furthermore, there is no co-existing alpha 1a-adrenoceptor in the sma.	a-61603 @chemical@ alpha 1a-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ jth-601 @chemical@ alpha 1l-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ chloroethylclonidine @chemical@ alpha 1b-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ bmy 7378 @chemical@ alpha 1d-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ rs-17053 @chemical@ alpha 1a-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
inhibition of neurite outgrowth and alteration of cytoskeletal gene expression by sodium arsenite. arsenic compounds that are often found in drinking water increase the risk of developmental brain disorders. in this study, we performed live imaging analyses of neuro-2a cells expressing scat3, a caspase-3 cleavage peptide sequence linking two fluorescent proteins; enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ecfp) and venus, to determine whether sodium arsenite (naaso(2); 0, 1, 5, or 10 μm) affects both neurite outgrowth and/or induces apoptosis with the same doses and in the same cell cultures. we observed that the area ratio of neurite to cell body in scat3-expressing cells was significantly reduced by 5 and 10 μm naaso(2), but not by 1 μm, although the emission ratio of ecfp to venus, an endpoint of caspase-3 activity, was not changed. however, cytological assay using apoptotic and necrotic markers resulted in that apoptosis, but not necrosis, was significantly induced in neuro-2a cells when naaso(2) exposure continued after the significant effects of naaso(2) on neurite outgrowth were found by live imaging. these results suggested that neurite outgrowth was suppressed by naaso(2) prior to naaso(2)-induced apoptosis. next, we examined the effects of naaso(2) on cytoskeletal gene expression in neuro-2a cells. naaso(2) increased the mrna levels of the light and medium subunits of neurofilament and decreased the mrna levels of tau and tubulin in a dose-dependent manner; no significant effect was found in the mrna levels of the heavy subunit of neurofilament, microtubule-associated protein 2, or actin. the changes in cytoskeletal gene expression are likely responsible for the inhibitory effects of naaso(2) on neurite outgrowth.	naaso(2) @chemical@ light and medium subunits of neurofilament @gene@ @cpr:3@ naaso(2) @chemical@ tau @gene@ @cpr:4@ naaso(2) @chemical@ tubulin @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
alcohol intoxications during adolescence increase motivation for alcohol in adult rats and induce neuroadaptations in the nucleus accumbens. adolescent alcohol binge drinking constitutes a major vulnerability factor to develop alcoholism. however, mechanisms underlying this susceptibility remain unknown. we evaluated the effect of adolescent binge-like ethanol intoxication on vulnerability to alcohol abuse in sprague-dawley rats. to model binge-like ethanol intoxication, every 2 days, rats received an ethanol injection (3.0 g/kg) for 2 consecutive days across 14 days either from postnatal day 30 (pnd30) to 43 (early adolescence) or from pnd 45 to pnd 58 (late adolescence). in young adult animals, we measured free ethanol consumption in the two-bottle choice paradigm, motivation for ethanol in the operant self-administration task and both ethanol's rewarding and aversive properties in the conditioned place preference (cpp) and taste aversion (cta) paradigms. while intermittent ethanol intoxications (iei) during late adolescence had no effect on free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, we found that iei during early adolescence promoted free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, enhanced motivation for ethanol in the self-administration paradigm and induced a loss of both ethanol-induced cpp and cta in young adults. no modification in either sucrose self-administration or amphetamine-induced cpp was observed. as the nucleus accumbens (nac) is particularly involved in addictive behavior, we analyzed iei-induced long-term neuroadaptations in the nac using c-fos immunohistochemistry and an array of neurotransmission-related genes. this vulnerability to ethanol abuse was associated with a lower c-fos immunoreactivity in the nac and enduring alterations of the expression of penk and slc6a4, 2 neurotransmission-related genes that have been shown to play critical roles in the behavioral effects of ethanol and alcoholism.	@norel@
synthesis and nir optical properties of hollow gold nanospheres with lspr greater than one micrometer. optical analysis in the near infrared region is of significant biological importance due to better tissue penetration and reduced autofluorescence. in this work, an improved synthesis of hollow gold nanospheres (hgns), which provides a tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (lspr) from 610 nm up to 1320 nm, is demonstrated. the scattering properties of these nanoparticles are shown using surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) at 1064 nm excitation wavelength and are compared to citrate reduced gold and silver nanoparticles of similar physical sizes and surface properties. after the addition of salts, a strong signal was observed from hollow gold with a lspr of 650 nm and a weaker, yet observable, signal from hgns with a lspr of 775 nm. however, no obvious signals were observed in the case of standard citrate reduced gold, silver or hgns with a lspr of 1080 nm. the absorption properties of hgns were investigated by monitoring their photothermal activity. in this case, different nanoparticle suspensions including citrate reduced gold, silver, and hgns were illuminated by a continuous laser at 785 nm excitation wavelength and the absorption efficiency of hgns with a lspr of 775 nm was calculated to be 0.81% which is more than 5 times higher than the absorption efficiency of citrate reduced gold nanoparticles under similar conditions.	@norel@
distinct roles of methamphetamine in modulating spatial memory consolidation, retrieval, reconsolidation and the accompanying changes of erk and creb activation in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. drugs of abuse modulated learning and memory in humans yet the underlying mechanism remained unclear. the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and the transcription factor camp response element-binding protein (creb) were involved in neuroplastic changes associated with learning and memory. in the current study, we used a morris water maze to examine the effect of methamphetamine (meth) on different processes of spatial memory in mice. we then investigated the status of erk and creb in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (pfc). we found that 1.0 mg/kg dose of meth facilitated spatial memory consolidation when it was injected immediately after the last learning trial. in contrast, the same dose of meth had no effect on spatial memory retrieval when it was injected 30 min before the test. furthermore, 1.0 mg/kg dose of meth injected immediately after retrieval had no effect on spatial memory reconsolidation. activation of both erk and creb in the hippocampus was found following memory consolidation but not after retrieval or reconsolidation in meth-treated mouse groups. in contrast, activation of both erk and creb in the pfc was found following memory retrieval but not other processes in meth-treated mouse groups. these results suggested that meth facilitated spatial memory consolidation but not retrieval or reconsolidation. moreover, activation of the erk and creb signaling pathway in the hippocampus might be involved in meth-induced spatial memory changes.	methamphetamine @chemical@ erk @gene@ @cpr:3@ methamphetamine @chemical@ creb @gene@ @cpr:3@ meth @chemical@ erk @gene@ @cpr:3@ meth @chemical@ creb @gene@ @cpr:3@ meth @chemical@ erk @gene@ @cpr:3@ meth @chemical@ creb @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
effectiveness of endopeptidase inhibition (candoxatril) in congestive heart failure. candoxatril is a novel, orally active inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase ec 3.4.24.11, the enzyme that degrades atrial natriuretic peptide (anp). the acute and chronic (10 days treatment) hemodynamic and hormonal effects of candoxatril (150 mg twice daily) in 12 patients with moderately severe congestive heart failure were investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. on study day 1, candoxatril acutely increased plasma anp levels, suppressed aldosterone and decreased right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. after 10 days of treatment, basal anp was increased and basal aldosterone was decreased. body weight was reduced, most likely reflecting chronic natriuretic or diuretic effects, or both, and there was a trend toward increased cardiac index and reduced preload values. on study day 10, the acute effects of candoxatril were similar to those on day 1 (i.e., anp was further increased, aldosterone was suppressed, and right and left ventricular filling pressures were decreased). thus, candoxatril may offer a new and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of heart failure.	candoxatril @chemical@ anp @gene@ @cpr:3@ candoxatril @chemical@ anp @gene@ @cpr:3@ candoxatril @chemical@ neutral endopeptidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ candoxatril @chemical@ ec 3.4.24.11 @gene@ @cpr:4@ candoxatril @chemical@ endopeptidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting : focus on newer agents and new uses for older agents. chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv) is associated with a significant deterioration in quality of life. the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, repeated chemotherapy cycles, and patient risk factors significantly influence cinv. the use of a combination of a serotonin 5-ht3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and a neurokinin 1 (nk1) receptor antagonist has significantly improved the control of acute and delayed emesis in single-day chemotherapy. palonosetron, a second-generation 5-ht3 receptor antagonist with a different half-life, a different binding capacity and a different mechanism of action than the first-generation 5-ht3 receptor antagonists appears to be the most effective agent in its class. aprepitant, the first and only agent clinically available in the nk1 receptor antagonist drug class has been used effectively as an additive agent to the 5-ht3 receptor antagonists and dexamethasone to control cinv. rolapitant and netupitant are other nk1 receptor antagonists that are currently in phase iii clinical trials. despite the control of emesis, nausea has not been well controlled by current agents. olanzapine, a us-fda approved antipsychotic, has emerged in recent trials as an effective preventative agent for cinv, as well as a very effective agent for the treatment of breakthrough emesis and nausea. clinical trials using gabapentin, cannabinoids and ginger have not been definitive regarding their efficacy in the prevention of cinv. additional studies are necessary for the control of nausea and for the control of cinv in the clinical settings of multiple-day chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.	palonosetron @chemical@ 5-ht3 @gene@ @cpr:6@ aprepitant @chemical@ nk1 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ rolapitant @chemical@ nk1 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ netupitant @chemical@ nk1 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
the mechanisms responsible for garlic - drug interactions and their in vivo relevance. garlic phytochemicals and garlic supplements influence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of concomitantly ingested drugs. in this paper we have summarized the mechanisms responsible for first-pass intestinal pharmacokinetic interactions by investigating the intestinal permeability of some cardiovascular, antiviral drugs, their transport with hepatic transporters and cyp3a4 metabolism. transporter-enzyme interplay was studied with several in vitro models of varying complexity: rat small intestine and caco-2 cell monolayers were used in studies of intestinal processes, and hepatic pharmacokinetics was monitored in hepg2 cells, isolated rat hepatocytes and rat liver slices. garlic phytochemicals from aged garlic extract modified the activities of secretory and absorptive transporters in both intestine and liver and competitively inhibited cyp3a4 enzyme. the increased activities of the most important intestinal efflux (p-glycoprotein - pgp, multidrug resistance associated protein 2 - mrp-2, breast cancer resistance protein - bcrp) and uptake (monocarboxylate transporter 1 - mct1, organic anion transporting polypeptide - oatp, peptide transporter 1 - pept1) transporters were caused by changes in electrophysiological membrane properties and by allosteric modifications. because clinical studies investigating interactions between garlic and human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors saquinavir and ritonavir have already been performed, we used these in vivo data to evaluate the in vitro results and the reliability of the models employed as screening tools for forecasting the potential of first-pass intestinal metabolism changes. we also assessed the probability of pharmacokinetic interactions with garlic of the novel drug darunavir and other cardiovascular drugs. finally, selected garlic phytochemicals were tested for their ability to influence p-glycoprotein and cyp3a4 activities.	saquinavir @chemical@ human immunodeficiency virus protease @gene@ @cpr:4@ ritonavir @chemical@ human immunodeficiency virus protease @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the type 2 diabetes associated gene ide is required for insulin secretion and suppression of α-synuclein levels in β-cells. genome wide association studies have identified several type 2 diabetes (t2d) risk loci linked to impaired β-cell function. the identity and function of the causal genes in these susceptibility loci remain, however, elusive. the hhex/ide t2d locus is associated with decreased insulin secretion in response to oral glucose stimulation in humans. here we have assessed β-cell function in ide knock-out (ko) mice. we find that glucose stimulated insulin secretion (gsis) is decreased in ide ko mice due to impaired replenishment of the releasable pool of granules and that the ide gene is haploinsufficient. we also show that autophagic flux and microtubule content is reduced in β-cells of ide ko mice. one important cellular role for ide involves the neutralization of amyloidogenic proteins and we find that α-synuclein and ide levels are inversely correlated in β-cells of ide ko mice and t2d patients. moreover, we provide evidence that both gain- and loss-of-function of α-synuclein in β-cells in vivo not only impair gsis but also autophagy. together, these data identify the ide gene as a regulator of gsis, suggest a molecular mechanism for β-cell degeneration as a consequence of ide deficiency, and additionally corroborates and extends a previously established important role for α-synuclein in β-cell function.	@norel@
structural model of carnitine palmitoyltransferase i based on the carnitine acetyltransferase crystal. cpt i (carnitine palmitoyltransferase i) catalyses the conversion of palmitoyl-coa into palmitoylcarnitine in the presence of l-carnitine, facilitating the entry of fatty acids into mitochondria. we propose a 3-d (three-dimensional) structural model for l-cpt i (liver cpt i), based on the similarity of this enzyme to the recently crystallized mouse carnitine acetyltransferase. the model includes 607 of the 773 amino acids of l-cpt i, and the positions of carnitine, coa and the palmitoyl group were assigned by superposition and docking analysis. functional analysis of this 3-d model included the mutagenesis of several amino acids in order to identify putative catalytic residues. mutants d477a, d567a and e590d showed reduced l-cpt i activity. in addition, individual mutation of amino acids forming the conserved ser685-thr686-ser687 motif abolished enzyme activity in mutants t686a and s687a and altered k(m) and the catalytic efficiency for carnitine in mutant s685a. we conclude that the catalytic residues are his473 and asp477, while ser687 probably stabilizes the transition state. several conserved lysines, i.e. lys455, lys505, lys560 and lys561, were also mutated. only mutants k455a and k560a showed decreases in activity of 50%. the model rationalizes the finding of nine natural mutations in patients with hereditary l-cpt i deficiencies.	palmitoylcarnitine @chemical@ cpt i @gene@ @cpr:9@ palmitoylcarnitine @chemical@ carnitine palmitoyltransferase i @gene@ @cpr:9@ palmitoyl-coa @chemical@ cpt i @gene@ @cpr:9@ palmitoyl-coa @chemical@ carnitine palmitoyltransferase i @gene@ @cpr:9@

conformational landscape of diisopropyl ketone: quantum chemical calculations validated by microwave spectroscopy. we report on the gas-phase structure of the most abundant conformer of diisopropyl ketone, (ch(3))(2)hc-co-ch(ch(3))(2), as observed by molecular beam fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. the gas-phase structures of five conformers of diisopropyl ketone were optimized using ab initio calculations at the mp2/6-311++g(d,p) level of theory. the natures of the stationary points were verified using harmonic frequency calculations. the only conformer observed in the supersonic jet possesses c(2) symmetry and appears as an enantiomeric pair. from the microwave spectrum, a set of three highly accurate rotational constants, five centrifugal distortion constants, and three sextic centrifugal distortion constants were determined. the structure of the observed conformer was optimized again at different levels of theory using the hf, mp2, and b3lyp methods. the theoretical constants of the c(2) conformer were subsequently validated using the experimental constants. to understand the transitions of one conformer to the others, the isopropyl groups were rotated against each other. the resulting two-dimensional potential energy surface shows nicely the symmetry of the conformational landscape and also indicates the enantiomeric pairs of the conformers. the barriers to internal rotation of the methyl groups were determined to be 1052 and 905 cm(-1) at the mp2/6-311++g(d,p) and the b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) levels, respectively. in agreement with the theoretical predictions, no internal rotation patterns could be observed in the microwave spectrum.	@norel@
contributions of rat ctr1 to the uptake and toxicity of copper and platinum anticancer drugs in dorsal root ganglion neurons. dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons are affected by platinum-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative processes associated with disturbed copper homeostasis and transport. this study aimed to understand the role of copper transporter 1 (ctr1) in the uptake and toxicity of copper and platinum drugs in cultured rat drg neurons, and the functional activities of rat ctr1 (rctr1) as a membrane transporter of copper and platinum drugs. heterologous expression of rctr1 in hek293 cells (hek/rctr1 cells) increased the uptake and cytotoxicity of copper, oxaliplatin, cisplatin and carboplatin, in comparison to isogenic vector-transfected control cells. cultured rat drg neurons endogenously expressed rctr1 protein on their neuronal cell body plasma membranes and cytoplasm, and displayed substantial capacity for taking up copper, but were resistant to copper toxicity. the uptake of copper by both cultured rat drg neurons and hek/rctr1 cells was saturable and inhibited by cold temperature, silver and zinc, consistent with it being mediated by rctr1. cultured rat drg neurons accumulated platinum during their exposure to oxaliplatin and were sensitive to oxaliplatin cytotoxicity. the accumulation of platinum by both cultured rat drg neurons and hek/rctr1 cells, during oxaliplatin exposure, was saturable and temperature dependent, but was inhibited by copper only in hek/rctr1 cells. in conclusion, rctr1 can transport copper and platinum drugs, and sensitizes cells to their cytotoxicities. drg neurons display substantial capacity for accumulating copper via a transport process mediated by rctr1, but appear able to resist copper toxicity and use alternative mechanisms to take up oxaliplatin.	platinum @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ copper @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ oxaliplatin @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ copper @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ copper @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ oxaliplatin @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ oxaliplatin @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cisplatin @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cisplatin @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ carboplatin @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ carboplatin @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ copper @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ copper @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ copper @chemical@ rat ctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ platinum @chemical@ rat ctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ copper @chemical@ rctr1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
effect of apocalmodulin on recombinant human brain glutamic acid decarboxylase. in this work, we report that the recombinant glutathione s-transferase (gst)-human l-glutamic acid decarboxylase (hgad) isoforms, 65-kda l-glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) (gst-hgad65) fusion protein or free truncated hgad65, were activated by apocalmodulin (apocam) to an extent of 60%. both truncated forms of gad67 (tgad67), hgad67(delta1-70) and hgad67(delta1-90), were markedly activated by apocam to an extent of 141 and 85%, respectively, while gst-hgad67 was not significantly affected. the activation appears to be due to an increase of gad affinity for its cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate (plp). this conclusion is based on the following observations. firstly, the v(max) of gad was increased when apocam was present whereas the affinity for the substrate, glutamate, was not affected. secondly, the affinity of gad for plp was increased in the presence of apocam. thirdly, results from calmodulin-agarose affinity column chromatography studies indicated a direct interaction or binding between apocam and gad. fourthly, apocam was found to be copurified with gad65/gad67 by anti-gad65/67 immunoaffinity column using rat brain extract. hence, it is proposed that a conformational change is induced when apocam interacts with gad65 or tgad67, resulting in an increase of gad affinity for plp and the activation of gad. the physiological significance of the interaction between gad and apocam is discussed.	glutamate @chemical@ gad @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
[short qt syndrome]. short qt syndrome is a new genetic disorder associated with familial atrial fibrillation and/or sudden death or syncope. to date, different mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels (kcnh2, kcnq1, and kcnj2) have been identified to cause the short qt syndrome. the mutations lead to a gain of function of the affected current (ikr, iks, and ik1). the phenotype is characterized by a shortened qt interval<335 ms after correction for heart rate at rates<80 beats/min. furthermore, the qt interval poorly adapts to heart rate. patients exhibit shortened atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods and, in the majority, inducibility of ventricular fibrillation. death occurs already in newborns. therapy of choice seems to be the implantable cardioverter defibrillator because of the high incidence of sudden death. pharmacological treatment has been studied and it could be demonstrated, that some mutant currents may be insufficiently suppressed by drugs targeted to block the specific current such as, e.g., sotalol or ibutilide in patients with a mutation in the ikr-coding gene kcnh2 (herg). quinidine proved to be efficient in prolonging the qt interval and normalizing the effective refractory periods in some patients.	sotalol @chemical@ ikr @gene@ @cpr:4@ sotalol @chemical@ kcnh2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sotalol @chemical@ herg @gene@ @cpr:4@ ibutilide @chemical@ ikr @gene@ @cpr:4@ ibutilide @chemical@ kcnh2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ibutilide @chemical@ herg @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
pirfenidone inhibits tgf-beta expression in malignant glioma cells. due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1h)-pyridone (pirfenidone, pfd) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces tgf-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. this reduction in tgf-beta2 is biologically relevant since pfd treatment reduces the growth inhibition of tgf-beta-sensitive ccl-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. the downregulation of tgf-beta is mediated at multiple levels. pfd leads to a reduction of tgf-beta2 mrna levels and of the mature tgf-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the tgf-beta pro-protein convertase furin. in addition, pfd reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-11, a tgf-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. these data define pfd or pfd-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced tgf-beta activity.	5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1h)-pyridone @chemical@ tgf-beta2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pirfenidone @chemical@ tgf-beta2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ pro-protein convertase @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ furin @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-11 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pirfenidone @chemical@ tgf-beta @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ pro-protein convertase @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ furin @gene@ @cpr:4@ pfd @chemical@ tgf-beta @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the role of platelet/lymphocyte serotonin transporter in depression and beyond. a large amount of the data gathered in the last 50 years support the hypothesis that alterations of the serotonin (5-ht) neurotransmission play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of not only major depression (md), but also of different neuropsychiatric disorders. research in this field has been substantially promoted by the evidence that the reuptake protein (sert), present in presynaptic neurons, is a key element in terminating the activity of the neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. for this reason, it was specifically targeted for the development of second-generation antidepressants, in particular of selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitors (ssris), with the aim of increasing the intrasynaptic 5-ht concentrations. moreover, since a lot of studies showed that circulating platelets and, more recently, lymphocytes possess functional sert proteins, they have been widely used as peripheral mirrors of the same structures located in the central nervous system. the presence of functional sert in blood cells suggests strict relationships between the nervous and the immune system that need to be better clarified in md, as well as the possibility of reciprocal modulation of the two systems by different drugs. this paper aims to review briefly the literature on the 5-ht hypothesis of depression with a major focus on the possible role of sert in this disorder, while highlighting how recent data are more oriented on dimensional rather than nosological involvement of this structure in different conditions spanning from normality to pathology.	@norel@
overexpression of h1 calponin in osteoblast lineage cells leads to a decrease in bone mass by disrupting osteoblast function and promoting osteoclast formation. h1 calponin (cnn1) is known as a smooth muscle-specific, actin-binding protein which regulates smooth muscle contractive activity. although previous studies have shown that cnn1 has effect on bone, the mechanism is not well defined. to investigate the role of cnn1 in maintaining bone homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing cnn1 under the control of the osteoblast-specific 3.6-kb col1a1 promoter. col1a1-cnn1 transgenic mice showed delayed bone formation at embryonic stage and decreased bone mass at adult stage. morphology analyses showed reduced trabecular number, thickness and defects in bone formation. the proliferation and migration of osteoblasts were decreased in col1a1-cnn1 mice due to alterations in cytoskeleton. the early osteoblast differentiation of col1a1-cnn1 mice was increased, but the late stage differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts derived from col1a1-cnn1 mice were significantly decreased. in addition to impaired bone formation, the decreased bone mass was also associated with enhanced osteoclastogenesis. tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap) staining revealed increased osteoclast numbers in tibias of 2-month-old col1a1-cnn1 mice, and increased numbers of osteoclasts co-cultured with col1a1-cnn1 osteoblasts. the ratio of rankl to opg was significantly increased in col1a1-cnn1 osteoblasts. these findings reveal a novel function of cnn1 in maintaining bone homeostasis by coupling bone formation to bone resorption.	@norel@
the role of combination medical therapy in benign prostatic hyperplasia. to review key trials of monotherapy and combination therapy of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists (alpha(1)-aras), 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5alpharis) and anti-muscarinic agents in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). to assess the safety and efficacy of combination therapies for luts associated with bph, a search of the medline and cochrane databases (1976-2008) was conducted for relevant trials and reviews using the terms benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists, 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, anti-muscarinics, anticholinergics, combination therapy, alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, dutasteride, finasteride, tolterodine, flavoxate, propiverine, oxybutynin, erectile dysfunction, sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil. data from the medical therapy of prostatic symptoms (mtops) study indicated a role for long-term use of alpha(1)-aras and 5alpharis in combination. in the mtops study, combination therapy with the alpha(1)-ara doxazosin and the 5alphari finasteride was significantly more effective than either component alone in reducing symptoms (p=0.006 vs doxazosin monotherapy; p<0.001 vs finasteride monotherapy) and in lowering the rate of clinical progression (p<0.001 vs either monotherapy). these findings were confirmed by the 2-year preliminary results of the combination of avodart and tamsulosin study. in this study, combination therapy of the alpha(1)-ara tamsulosin and the 5alphari dutasteride resulted in a significantly greater decrease in international prostate symptom score (ipss) when compared with either monotherapy. several recent trials have studied the efficacy of combining alpha(1)-aras and anti-muscarinic agents in the treatment of bph. these studies have found this combination to result in statistically significant benefits in quality of life scores, patient satisfaction, urinary frequency, storage symptoms and ipss scores. studies have not shown an increased risk of urinary retention associated with the use of anti-muscarinics in a highly select cohort of men with bph. the available data suggest that combination therapy can be beneficial in the treatment of bph and associated luts. the greatest efficacy for the alpha(1)-ara and 5alphari combination was shown in patients with larger prostate size and more severe symptoms. the combination of alpha(1)-aras and 5alpharis appears to prevent disease progression in these patients. the combination of alpha(1)-aras with anti-muscarinic agents is useful for relieving symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor overactivity. theoretic concerns regarding the risk of acute urinary retention have been refuted in several recent clinical trials; however, it must be noted that the patients in these trials were a highly select cohort of men. men with overactive bladder and bph who are not receiving adequate alleviation of symptoms from the first-line alpha(1)-aras may benefit from the addition of an anti-muscarinic agent.	@norel@
molecular determinants for the selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 by lumiracoxib. lumiracoxib is the first example of a marketed cox-2 inhibitor of the arylacetic acid class, and it is reported to be the most selective coxib in vivo. however, the molecular basis of its cox-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine cox-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human cox-2. the extent of cox-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human cox-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for cox-2 selectivity. the chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of cox inhibition as well as cox-2 selectivity. mutation of ser-530 to ala or val-349 to ala or leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human cox-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. interestingly, a val-349 to ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human cox-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-cox-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant cox-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of cox-2 inhibition.	2,6-dichloro @chemical@ val-349 to ile @gene@ @cpr:4@ 2,6-dichloro @chemical@ human cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 2,6-dimethyl @chemical@ val-349 to ile @gene@ @cpr:4@ 2,6-dimethyl @chemical@ human cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 2-chloro-6-methyl @chemical@ val-349 to ile @gene@ @cpr:4@ 2-chloro-6-methyl @chemical@ human cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ val-349 to ile @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ human cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ cox-2s @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ ovine cox-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ human cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ human cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ arylacetic acid @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ methyl @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ phenylacetic acid @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ cyclooxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ aniline @chemical@ cox @gene@ @cpr:4@ lumiracoxib @chemical@ human cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
gene deletion reveals roles for annexin a1 in the regulation of lipolysis and il-6 release in epididymal adipose tissue. in this study, epididymal adipose tissue from male annexin 1 (anxa1)-null and wild-type control mice were used to explore the potential role of anxa1 in adipocyte biology. anxa1 was detected by western blot analysis in wild-type tissue and localized predominantly to the stromal-vascular compartment. epididymal fat pad mass was reduced by anxa1 gene deletion, but adipocyte size was unchanged, suggesting that anxa1 is required for the maintenance of adipocyte and/or preadipocyte cell number. epididymal tissue from wild-type mice responded in vitro to noradrenaline and isoprenaline with increased glycerol release, reduced il-6 release, and increased camp accumulation. qualitatively similar but significantly attenuated responses to the catecholamines were observed in tissue from anxa1-null mice, an effect that was not associated with changes in beta-adrenoceptor mrna expression. lipopolysaccharide (lps) also stimulated lipolysis in vitro, but its effects were muted by anxa1 gene deletion. by contrast, lps failed to influence il-6 release from wild-type tissue but stimulated the release of the cytokine from tissue from anxa1-null mice. anxa1 gene deletion did not affect glucocorticoid receptor expression or the ability of dexamethasone to suppress catecholamine-induced lipolysis. it did, however, augment il-6 expression and modify the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on il-6 release. collectively, these studies suggest that anxa1 supports aspects of adipose tissue mass and alters the sensitivity of epididymal adipose tissue to catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and lps, thereby modulating lipolysis and il-6 release.	noradrenaline @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ isoprenaline @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
human serum albumin-based design of a diflunisal prodrug. the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, diflunisal, is used in the clinic for its anti-inflammatory activity. about 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (hsa). to reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. the crystal structure of hsa complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the iia subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates lys199. the acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of hsa-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.	diflunisal @chemical@ cyclooxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
hepatocytes display a compensatory survival response against cadmium toxicity by a mechanism mediated by egfr and src. although the liver is a cadmium-target organ, hepatocyte response involved in its toxicity is not yet elucidated. a link between this heavy metal treatment and stat3 signaling pathways was examined in primary mouse hepatocytes. we provided evidence of a novel link among nadph oxidase and stat3 signaling, mediated by src, egfr, and erk1/2. cadmium activates nadph oxidase. ros produced by this oxidase activates src, enable that in turn, transactivates egfr that activates stat3 in tyrosine, allowing its dimerization. also, ros from nadph oxidase favors erk1/2 activation that phosphorylates stat3 in serine, resulting in a compensatory or adaptive survival response such as production of metallothionein-ii in short cd exposure times. however, after 12h cdcl2 treatment, cell viability diminished in 50%, accompanied by a drastic decrease of metallothionein-ii production, and an increase in p53 activation and the pro-apoptotic protein bax.	cadmium @chemical@ nadph oxidase @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdcl2 @chemical@ p53 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdcl2 @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdcl2 @chemical@ metallothionein-ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
green approach&#8212;multicomponent production of boron&#8212;containing hantzsch and biginelli esters. multicomponent reactions are excellent methods that meet the requirements of green chemistry, by reducing the number of steps, and consequently reducing purification requirements. accordingly, in this work, 11 novel hybrid-boron-containing molecules, namely eight 1,4-dihydropyridines and three 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones, derived from formylphenylboronic acids (ortho, meta and para), were obtained using a green approach, involving h-4cr and b-3cr practices, in the presence of ethanol, which is a green solvent, and using three comparatively different modes of activation (mantle heating, yield 3%-7% in 24 h, infrared radiation (ir) irradiation, yield 12%-17% in 12 h, and microwave irradiation, yield 18%-80%, requiring very low reaction times of 0.25-0.33 h). in addition, as a green-approach is offered, a convenient analysis, of the 12 green chemistry principles for the overall procedure was performed. finally, since all the products are new, characterizations were carried out using common analytic procedures (1h, 11b, and 13c nmr, fab+ms, hrms, and ir). the accurate mass data of unexpected ions related to interactions between thioglycerol and the expected products, in the fab+-mode, enabled unequivocal characterization of the target molecules.	@norel@
serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine reciprocal interactions as putative molecular targets for novel antipsychotic treatments: from receptor heterodimers to postsynaptic scaffolding and effector proteins. the physical and functional interactions between serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine signaling have been suggested to be involved in psychosis pathophysiology and are supposed to be relevant for antipsychotic treatment. type ii metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) and serotonin 5-ht(2a) receptors have been reported to form heterodimers that modulate g-protein-mediated intracellular signaling differentially compared to mglur2 and 5-ht(2a) homomers. additionally, direct evidence has been provided that d(2) and 5-ht(2a) receptors form physical heterocomplexes which exert a functional cross-talk, as demonstrated by studies on hallucinogen-induced signaling. moving from receptors to postsynaptic density (psd) scenario, the scaffolding protein psd-95 is known to interact with n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda), d(2) and 5-ht(2) receptors, regulating their activation state. homer1a, the inducible member of the homer family of psd proteins that is implicated in glutamatergic signal transduction, is induced in striatum by antipsychotics with high dopamine receptor affinity and in the cortex by antipsychotics with mixed serotonergic/dopaminergic profile. signaling molecules, such as akt and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3 (gsk-3), could be involved in the mechanism of action of antipsychotics, targeting dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate neurotransmission. altogether, these proteins stand at the crossroad of glutamate-dopamine-serotonin signaling pathways and may be considered as valuable molecular targets for current and new antipsychotics. the aim of this review is to provide a critical appraisal on serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine interplay to support the idea that next generation schizophrenia pharmacotherapy should not exclusively rely on receptor targeting strategies.	@norel@
effects of an ethanolic salix extract on the release of selected inflammatory mediators in vitro. salix extracts are in current use for the treatment of pain and inflammation. in order to obtain an insight into the mechanism(s) of action of the ethanolic salix extract 1520l--which is essentially similar to an extract for which clinical studies have demonstrated analgesic effectiveness--its effects were evaluated in an established in vitro assay test system using primary human monocytes. the ic50-values obtained for the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced release of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) reflecting cyclooxygenase (cox)-2-mediated pge2 release were 47 microg/ml and 0.6 microg/ml, for the salix extract 1520l and rofecoxib-like research compound l745337, respectively. there was no effect on cox-1 and cox-2 activity. the salix extract inhibited the lps-induced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 with ic50-values of 180.0, 33.0 and 86.0 microg/ml, respectively. both, salicin and salicylate, had no effect in any of the parameters. our results indicate that salix extract 1520l inhibits cox-2-mediated pge2 release through compounds other than salicin or salicylate. our data further suggest that the proprietary salix extract is a weak inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines.	pge2 @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ pge2 @chemical@ cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
β-cells are not generated in pancreatic duct ligation-induced injury in adult mice. the existence of adult β-cell progenitors remains the most controversial developmental biology topic in diabetes research. it has been reported that β-cell progenitors can be activated by ductal ligation-induced injury of adult mouse pancreas and apparently act in a cell-autonomous manner to double the functional β-cell mass within a week by differentiation and proliferation. here, we demonstrate that pancreatic duct ligation (pdl) does not activate progenitors to contribute to β-cell mass expansion. rather, pdl stimulates massive pancreatic injury, which alters pancreatic composition and thus complicates accurate measurement of β-cell content via traditional morphometry methodologies that superficially sample the pancreas. to overcome this potential bias, we quantified β-cells from the entire pancreas and observed that β-cell mass and insulin content are totally unchanged by pdl-induced injury. lineage-tracing studies using sequential administration of thymidine analogs, rat insulin 2 promoter-driven cre-lox, and low-frequency ubiquitous cre-lox reveal that pdl does not convert progenitors to the β-cell lineage. thus, we conclude that β-cells are not generated in injured adult mouse pancreas.	@norel@
conjugated linoleic acid and calcium co-supplementation improves bone health in ovariectomised mice. osteoporosis is a significant health concern for the elderly; conjugated linoleic acid (cla) has been shown to improve overall bone mass when calcium is included as a co-supplement. however, potential effects of cla and calcium on bone mass during a period of bone loss have not been reported. the purpose of this study was to determine how dietary calcium modulates the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in preventing bone loss, using an ovariectomised mouse model. cla supplementation significantly prevented ovariectomy-associated weight and fat mass gain, compared to non-supplemented controls. cla significantly increased bone markers without major changes in bone mineral composition in the femur compared to respective controls. cla treatment increased serum parathyroid hormone (pth) significantly (p=0.0172), while serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 concentration was not changed by cla. meanwhile, cla significantly reduced femur tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (trap) activity, suggesting potential reduction of osteoclastogenesis. the data suggest that cla, along with dietary calcium, has great potential to be used to prevent bone loss and weight gain associated with menopause.	@norel@
medroxyprogesterone acetate but not drospirenone ablates the protective function of 17 beta-estradiol in aldosterone salt-treated rats. controversial results obtained from human and animal studies on the prevention of heart disease by estrogens and progestins warrant a better understanding of nuclear hormone receptor function and interaction. to address this issue and taking into account that effects of synthetic progestins are not only referable to action through the progesterone receptor but may also be mediated by other steroid receptors, we characterized cardiovascular function and inflammatory gene expression in aldosterone salt-treated rats on long-term administration of 17beta-estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and drospirenone, a new progestogen exhibiting antimineralocorticoid activity. the complex pattern of cardiovascular injury in ovariectomized wistar rats induced by chronic aldosterone infusion plus a high-salt diet was significantly attenuated in sham-ovariectomized rats and by coadministration of 17beta-estradiol in ovariectomized animals after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. the beneficial role of 17beta-estradiol on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular osteopontin expression, perivascular fibrosis, and impaired no-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings was completely abrogated by coadministration of medroxyprogesterone acetate. in contrast, drospirenone was either neutral or additive to 17beta-estradiol in protecting against aldosterone salt-induced cardiovascular injury and inflammation. the current results support the hypothesis of complex interactions among estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, androgen, and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in cardiovascular injury and inflammation. novel progestins, such as drospirenone, confer superior effects compared with medroxyprogesterone acetate in a model of aldosterone-induced heart disease because of its antimineralocorticoid properties.	17beta-estradiol @chemical@ osteopontin @gene@ @cpr:3@ medroxyprogesterone acetate @chemical@ osteopontin @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
a significant dose-dependent relationship between mercury exposure from dental amalgams and kidney integrity biomarkers: a further assessment of the casa pia children's dental amalgam trial. dental amalgams are a commonly used dental restorative material. amalgams are about 50% mercury (hg), and hg is known to significantly accumulate in the kidney. it was hypothesized that because hg accumulates in the proximal tubules (pts), glutathione-s-transferases (gst)-α (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of pt) would be expected to be more related to hg exposure than gst-π (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of the distal tubules). urinary biomarkers of kidney integrity were examined in children of 8-18 years old, with and without dental amalgam fillings, from a completed clinical trial (parent study). our study determined whether there was a significant dose-dependent correlation between increasing hg exposure from dental amalgams and gst-α and gst-π as biomarkers of kidney integrity. overall, the present study, using a different and more sensitive statistical model than the parent study, revealed a statistically significant dose-dependent correlation between cumulative exposure to hg from dental amalgams and urinary levels of gst-α, after covariate adjustment; where as, a nonsignificant relationship was observed with urinary levels of gst-π. furthermore, it was observed that urinary gst-α levels increased by about 10% over the 8-year course of the study among individuals with an average exposure to amalgams among the study subjects from the amalgam group, in comparison with study subjects with no exposure to dental amalgams. the results of our study suggest that dental amalgams contribute to ongoing kidney damage at the level of the pts in a dose-dependent fashion.	@norel@
plasma s/r ratio of warfarin co-varies with vkorc1 haplotype. we recently reported that the low-dose vkorc1*2 haplotype is an important genetic determinant for warfarin dose requirement and is associated with difficulties to attain stable therapeutic prothrombin time--international normalized ratio in patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy. the aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with vkorc1*2 compared with patients carrying high-dose haplotypes vkorc1*3 or vkorc1*4 had different warfarin s/r ratios in their plasma, and whether that was related to cyp2c9 variants cyp2c9*2 and cyp2c9*3 or other factors. samples from patients previously haplotyped for vkorc1 and measured for plasma warfarin concentration were genotyped for the cyp2c9 variants cyp2c9*2 and cyp2c9*3. nonparametric statistical analysis was performed to elucidate whether there was any significant difference in the warfarin s/r ratio between the two patient groups. our result shows that there is a significant difference (p<0.01) in warfarin s/r ratios between vkorc1*2 and vkorc1*3 or vkorc1*4 patients. this difference did not originate from cyp2c9 variants cyp2c9*2 and cyp2c9*3. we speculate that vkorc1 haplotypes possibly are linked to some unidentified factors involved in the metabolic clearance of warfarin enantiomers. dose-dependent variations in (s)-warfarin and (r)-warfarin clearance in these patients can also be a probable explanation for the difference in warfarin s/r ratios.	@norel@
peyer's patch-mediated intestinal immune system modulating activity of pectic-type polysaccharide from peel of citrus unshiu. an intestinal immune system modulating polysaccharide (cui-3iib-3-2, 18kda) was purified from citrus unshiu peel. cui-3iib-3-2 mainly comprised gala, glca, ara, gal and rha, and it consisted of 4-linked gala, terminal araf, 4- or 5-linked/3,4- or 3,5-branched ara, terminal gal, and 2-linked/2,4-branched rha. after cui-3iib-3-2 digestion by endo-α-d-(1→4)-polygalacturonase, its hydrolysate was fractionated into pg-1 and pg-2. methylation analyses of pg-1 and pg-2 using base-catalysed β-elimination suggested that cui-3iib-3-2 be assumed as pectic-type polysaccharide. since the activities of pg-1 and pg-2 were potently decreased, the whole polysaccharide structure of cui-3iib-3-2 would be essential to maintain the activity. meanwhile, when cui-3iib was orally administered in mice, bone marrow cell proliferation and gm-csf/il-6 production from peyer's patch cell were significantly higher (1.76- and 2.03/2.51-fold, respectively) than a saline. therefore, a pectic-type polysaccharide from citrus peel could stimulate peyer's patches and produce hematopoietic growth factors resulted in bone marrow cell proliferation.	@norel@
the effects of the adenosine a3 receptor agonist ib-meca on sodium taurocholate-induced experimental acute pancreatitis. the role of adenosine a3 receptors and their distribution in the gastrointestinal tract have been widely investigated. most of the reports discuss their role in intestinal inflammations. however, the role of adenosine a3 receptor agonist in pancreatitis has not been well established. the aim of this study is (ed note: purpose statements should be in present tense) to evaluate the effects of the adenosine a3 receptor agonist on the course of sodium taurocholate-induced experimental acute pancreatitis (eap). the experiments were performed on 80 male wistar rats, 58 of which survived, subdivided into 3 groups: c-control rats, i-eap group, and ii-eap group treated with the adenosine a3 receptor agonist ib-meca (1-deoxy-1-6[[(3-iodophenyl) methyl]amino]-9h-purin-9-yl)-n-methyl-b-d-ribofuronamide at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg b.w. i.p. at 48, 24, 12 and 1 h before and 1 h after the injection of 5 % sodium taurocholate solution into the biliary-pancreatic duct. serum for α-amylase and lipase determinations and tissue samples for morphological examinations were collected at 2, 6, and 24 h of the experiment. in the ib-meca group, α-amylase activity was decreased with statistically high significance compared to group i. the activity of lipase was not significantly different among the experimental groups but higher than in the control group. the administration of ib-meca attenuated the histological parameters of inflammation as compared to untreated animals. the use of a3 receptor agonist ib-meca attenuates eap. our findings suggest that stimulation of adenosine a3 receptors plays a positive role in the sodium taurocholate-induced eap in rats.	ib-meca @chemical@ α-amylase @gene@ @cpr:4@ ib-meca @chemical@ adenosine a3 receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ (1-deoxy-1-6[[(3-iodophenyl) methyl]amino]-9h-purin-9-yl)-n-methyl-b-d-ribofuronamide @chemical@ adenosine a3 receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ ib-meca @chemical@ adenosine a3 receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ ib-meca @chemical@ a3 receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ 
structural investigation and biological activity of sesquiterpene lactones from the traditional chinese herb inula racemosa. five new sesquiterpene lactones, racemosalactones a-e (1-5), along with 19 known sesquiterpene latones (6-24), were isolated from the roots of inula racemosa. their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configuration of 2 was deduced from x-ray diffraction analysis. compounds 1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 17 exhibited antiproliferative activities with ic50 values ranging from 0.38 to 4.19 μg/ml against human non-small-cell lung cancer a549, hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2, and human fibrosarcoma ht1080 cells. compounds 6 and 8 exhibited antiproliferative activities against endothelial cells with ic50 values of 2.4 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. furthermore, compounds 6 and 8 both inhibited endothelial cell tube formation at 1.0 μg/ml. a method for the rapid and straightforward preparative-scale isolation of compound 6 from alantolides is described.	@norel@
structural basis for the atp-induced isomerization of kinesin. kinesin superfamily proteins (kifs) are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by the energy derived from the hydrolysis of atp. previous studies have revealed that the atp binding step is crucial both for the power stroke to produce motility and for the inter-domain regulation of atpase activity to guarantee the processive movement of dimeric kifs. here, we report the first crystal structure of kif4 complexed with the non-hydrolyzable atp analog, amppnp (adenylyl imidodiphosphate), at 1.7å resolution. by combining our structure with previously solved kif1a structures complexed with two atp analogs, molecular snapshots during atp binding reveal that the closure of the nucleotide-binding pocket during atp binding is achieved by closure of the backdoor. closure of the backdoor stabilizes two mobile regions, switch i and switch ii, to generate the phosphate tube from which hydrolyzed phosphate is released. through the stabilization of switch ii, the local conformational change at the catalytic center is further relayed to the neck-linker element that fully docks to the catalytic core to produce the power stroke. because the neck linker is a sole element that connects the partner heads in dimeric kifs, this tight structural coordination between the catalytic center and neck linker enables inter-domain communication between the partner heads. this study also revealed the putative microtubule-binding site of kif4, thus providing structural insights that describe the specific binding of kif4 to the microtubule.	@norel@
vandetanib: opening a new treatment practice in advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma. medullary thyroid cancer (mtc) is frequently diagnosed in a locally advanced or metastatic stage, and 10-year survival rates in these cases are below 20 %. cytotoxic chemotherapy has no significant impact on overall or progression-free survival. vandetanib (caprelsa(®), astrazeneca) is a once-daily oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits signalling mediated by growth-factor receptor tyrosine kinase ret (constitutively activated in roughly 60 % of all mtcs), vascular endothelial growth-factor receptors 2 and 3, and epidermal growth-factor receptors. it is the first systemic drug with demonstrated anti-tumor benefits in advanced mtc, and it has recently been approved for locally advanced or metastatic mtc by the united states food and drug administration (april 2011) and the european medicines agency (february 2012). this review, starting from the phases ii and iii efficacy and safety data that led to these approvals, explores important issues related to dosing, patient selection, and strategies for managing the substantial risk of toxicity associated with the drug (including life-threatening cardiac events that are the subject of a black-box warning in the united states). all these issues still remain to be defined. vandetanib is becoming a standard of care for symptomatic, progressive, metastatic mtcs, to be used selectively in those patients who are likely to benefit from it.	vandetanib @chemical@ epidermal growth-factor receptors @gene@ @cpr:4@ vandetanib @chemical@ tyrosine kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ vandetanib @chemical@ growth-factor receptor tyrosine kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ vandetanib @chemical@ ret @gene@ @cpr:4@ caprelsa @chemical@ epidermal growth-factor receptors @gene@ @cpr:4@ caprelsa @chemical@ tyrosine kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
reversible inhibition of human carboxylesterases by acyl glucuronides. carboxylesterases hydrolyze esters, amides, and thioesters to produce carboxylic acids and resulting alcohols, amines, and thiols, respectively. uridine 5'-diphosphate- glucuronosyltransferases are colocalized with carboxylesterases and have the potential to further metabolize carboxylic acids to acyl glucuronides, but it is currently unknown if acyl glucuronides, being esters, also interact with carboxylesterases. objective: this study explores the ability of acyl glucuronides to act as substrates or inhibitors of human carboxylesterases 1 (hces1) and 2 (hces2). methods: the stability of six acyl glucuronides in the presence of hces1, hces2, and buffer alone (100 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.4, 37°c) were investigated. reversible inhibition of 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis by the acyl glucuronides was also studied. diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide was used to explore potential time-dependent inactivation. results: the chemical stability half-life values for cgp 47292-β-d-glucuronide, diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide, (r)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide, (s)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide, ibuprofen-β-d-glucuronide (racemic), clopidogrel-β-d-glucuronide, and valproate-β-d-glucuronide were found to be 0.252, 0.537, 0.996, 1.77, 3.67, 5.02, and 15.2 hours, respectively. diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide, clopidogrel-β-d-glucuronide, ibuprofen-β-d-glucuronide, (r)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide, and (s)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide selectively inhibited hces1, with ki values of 4.32 ± 0.47, 24.8 ± 4.2, 355 ± 38, 468 ± 21, 707 ± 64 µm, respectively, but did not significantly inhibit hces2. valproate-β-d-glucuronide and cgp 47292-β-d-glucuronide did not inhibit either hces. time-dependent inactivation of hces1 by diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide was not observed. lastly, both hces1 and hces2 were shown not to catalyze the hydrolysis of the acyl glucuronides studied. conclusion: drug-drug interaction studies may be warranted for drugs that metabolize to acyl glucuronides due to the potential inhibition of hcess.	clopidogrel-β-d-glucuronide @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ibuprofen-β-d-glucuronide @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ (r)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ (s)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ hcess @gene@ @cpr:4@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ human carboxylesterases 1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ hces2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ human carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:4@ diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ alcohols @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ uridine 5'-diphosphate- glucuronosyltransferases @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ uridine 5'-diphosphate- glucuronosyltransferases @gene@ @cpr:9@ carboxylic acids @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ amines @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ thiols @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ carboxylic acids @chemical@ uridine 5'-diphosphate- glucuronosyltransferases @gene@ @cpr:9@ carboxylic acids @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ esters @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ amides @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ human carboxylesterases 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ hces2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ thioesters @chemical@ carboxylesterases @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ hces1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ acyl glucuronides @chemical@ hces2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
tcf7l2 variation and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. proliferative diabetic retinopathy (pdr) is the most severe vision-threatening complication of diabetes. to investigated genetic association between tcf7l2 and pdr in caucasian type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and its functional consequences, 383 t2dm patients with pdr (t2dm-pdr) and 756 t2dm patients without diabetic retinopathy (t2dm-no dr) were genotyped with rs7903146 in tcf7l2. we found that risk allele (t) frequency of rs7903146 was significantly higher in t2dm-pdr patients (allelic p = 2.52e-04). in lymphoblastoid cells induced to undergo endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress by treatment of tunicamycin, higher fold change of tcf7l2 and vegfa mrna levels were observed in rs7903146-tt cells than that in rs7903146-cc cells (p = 0.02 for tcf7l2; p = 0.004 for vegfa), suggesting er stress plays a role in pdr pathogenesis. silencing tcf7l2 resulted in decreased mrna levels of both tcf7l2 and vegfa (p < 0.001). retinas of oxygen-induced retinopathy (oir) mice (a model for pdr) had higher tcf7l2 and vegfa mrna levels than controls (p = 2.9e-04 for tcf7l2; p = 1.9e-07 for vegfa). together, our study showed that tcf7l2-rs7903146 is associated with pdr in caucasian t2dm and suggested tcf7l2 promoted pathological retinal neovascularization via er stress-dependent upregulation of vegfa.	@norel@
the food contaminant deoxynivalenol activates the mitogen activated protein kinases in the intestine: interest of ex vivo models as an alternative to in vivo experiments. trichothecenes induce changes in the intestinal barrier function through decreased expression of cell junction proteins and apoptosis of enterocytes. the mitogen activated protein kinases (mapk) play an important role in the signaling pathways of cell turnover and differentiation. using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, the purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of low doses of don to induce histological changes in the intestine and to activate the mapk erk 1/2, p38 and jnk. twelve weaning piglets received during four weeks a control diet or a don-contaminated diet (2.3 mg don/kg feed). six weaning piglets were used to prepare jejunal explants (ex vivo model). explants were exposed during 4 h to vehicle, 5 or 10 μm don. intestinal changes were graded using a histological score. pigs fed a don-diet and explants exposed to don showed a significant decrease in the jejunal score. in both models, the toxin significantly enhanced phosphorylation of erk 1/2 and p38, whereas the increased phosphorylation of jnk was non significant. taken together these results indicate that in vivo or ex vivo exposure of intestinal tissue to don lead to similar intestinal lesions and activation of mapk. these effects could impair the homeostasis of intestinal tissue in the aspects of barrier function and immune protection. the similarity of the in vivo and ex vivo results provides also strong evidence that the jejunal explant model is a good alternative for toxicological studies in intestinal tissue.	don @chemical@ mapk @gene@ @cpr:3@ deoxynivalenol @chemical@ mitogen activated protein kinases @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
fibrillar morphology of derivatives of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s by solvent vapor annealing: effects of conformational transition and conjugate length. a fibrillar morphology was obtained, compared to the featherless pristine films, via solvent annealing the films of a series of derivatives of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (p3ats): poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (p3ddt), poly(3,3‴-didodecyl-quaterthiophene) (pqt12), and poly(2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (pbttt12). among the solvents used, including dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and carbon disulfide (cs2), cs2 was the best to induce fibril formation because its solubility parameter is closest to those of the p3at derivatives. it was found that higher critical cs2 vapor pressures were needed to form crystal nuclei with increasing conjugation length and molecular weight of the p3at derivatives; i.e., the critical vapor pressures for p3ddt 13.9k and pqt12 15.5k were 59.0% and 80.7%, respectively, and there were no nuclei of fibrils for pbttt12 15.6k with the highest conjugation length, even at a cs2 vapor pressure of 98.3%. meanwhile, at the highest vapor pressure, the fibril density decreased with increasing conjugation length and molecular weight of the p3at derivatives. this is attributed to the rod-like conformation prevailing for polymers with larger conjugation length and higher molecular weight during solvent annealing, making the conformational transition toward coils more difficult and hindering diffusion of molecules. the results presented here are expected to be helpful for the design and processing of conjugated semiconductor polymers.	@norel@
deficits in male sexual behavior in adulthood after social instability stress in adolescence in rats. there is increasing evidence that exposure to stressors in adolescence has long-lasting effects on emotional and cognitive behavior, but little is known as to whether reproductive functions are affected. we investigated appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior in male rats that were exposed to chronic social instability stress (ss, n=24) for 16 days in mid-adolescence compared to control rats (ctl, n=24). over five sexual behavior test sessions with a receptive female, ss rats made fewer ejaculations (p=0.02) and had longer latencies to ejaculation (p=0.03). when only data from rats that ejaculated in the fifth session were analyzed, ss rats (n=18) had reduced copulatory efficiency (more mounts and intromissions before ejaculation) compared to ctl rats (n=19) (p=0.004), and ctl rats were twice as likely as ss rats to make more than one ejaculation in the fifth session (p=0.05). further, more ctl (14/24) than ss (5/25) rats ejaculated in four or more sessions (p=0.05). ss rats had lower plasma testosterone concentrations than ctl rats (p=0.05), but did not differ in androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, or fos immunoreactive cell counts in the medial preoptic area. the groups did not differ in a partner preference test administered between the fourth and fifth sexual behavior session. the results suggest that developmental history contributes to individual differences in reproductive behavior, and that stress exposures in adolescence may be a factor in sexual sluggishness.	@norel@
formation of mallory body-like inclusions and cell death induced by deregulated expression of keratin 18. mallory bodies (mbs) are cytoplasmic inclusions that contain keratin 8 (k8) and k18 and are present in hepatocytes of individuals with alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or benign or malignant hepatocellular neoplasia. mice fed long term with griseofulvin are an animal model of mb formation. however, the lack of a cellular model has impeded understanding of the molecular mechanism of this process. culture of hepg2 cells with griseofulvin has now been shown to induce both the formation of intracellular aggregates containing k18 as well as an increase in the abundance of k18 mrna. overexpression of k18 in hepg2, hela, or cos-7 cells also induced the formation of intracellular aggregates that stained with antibodies to ubiquitin and with rhodamine b (characteristics of mbs formed in vivo), eventually leading to cell death. the mb-like aggregates were deposited around centrosomes and disrupted the microtubular array. coexpression of k8 with k18 restored the normal fibrous pattern of keratin distribution and reduced the toxicity of k18. in contrast, an nh(2)-terminal deletion mutant of k8 promoted the formation of intracellular aggregates even in the absence of k18 overexpression. deregulated expression of k18, or an imbalance between k8 and k18, may thus be an important determinant of mb formation, which compromises the function of centrosomes and the microtubule network and leads to cell death.	griseofulvin @chemical@ k18 @gene@ @cpr:3@ griseofulvin @chemical@ k18 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
effects of a k(+) channel opener to reduce transmural dispersion of repolarization and prevent torsade de pointes in lqt1, lqt2, and lqt3 models of the long-qt syndrome. background: this study examines the effects of nicorandil, a k(+) channel opener, on transmural dispersion of repolarization (tdr) and induction of torsade de pointes (tdp) under conditions mimicking the lqt1, lqt2, and lqt3 forms of the congenital long-qt syndrome (lqts). methods and results: transmembrane action potentials of epicardial, m, and endocardial cells were recorded simultaneously from an arterially perfused wedge of canine left ventricle together with a transmural ecg. chromanol 293b (30 micromol/l) was used to block i(ks) (lqt1 model). isoproterenol (50 to 100 nmol/l) was used to mimic an increase in beta-adrenergic tone, d-sotalol (100 micromol/l) to block i(kr) (lqt2 model), and atx-ii (20 nmol/l) to augment late i(na) (lqt3 model). isoproterenol+chromanol 293b, d-sotalol, and atx-ii produced preferential prolongation of the action potential duration at 90% repolarization (apd(90)) of the m cell, an increase of tdr, and spontaneous as well as stimulation-induced tdp (lqt1, 3/6; lqt2, 3/6; lqt3, 5/6). nicorandil (2 to 20 micromol/l) abbreviated the qt interval and apd(90) of the 3 cell types in the 3 models. high concentrations (10 to 20 micromol/l) completely reversed the effects of 293b+/-isoproterenol and those of d-sotalol to increase apd(90) and tdr and to induce tdp in lqt1 and lqt2 models. nicorandil 20 micromol/l reversed only 50% of the effect of atx-ii and failed to completely suppress tdp in the lqt3 model (5/6 to 3/6). conclusions: our data suggest that k(+) channel openers may be capable of abbreviating the long qt interval, reducing tdr, and preventing spontaneous and stimulation-induced tdp when congenital or acquired lqts is secondary to reduced i(kr) or i(ks) but less so when it is due to augmented late i(na).	nicorandil @chemical@ k(+) channel @gene@ @cpr:3@ d-sotalol @chemical@ i(kr) @gene@ @cpr:4@ d-sotalol @chemical@ atx-ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ isoproterenol @chemical@ i(kr) @gene@ @cpr:4@ isoproterenol @chemical@ atx-ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the interaction between mglur1 and the calcium channel cav₂.₁ preserves coupling in the presence of long homer proteins. group i metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglur1 and 5) are g protein coupled receptors that regulate neuronal activity in a number of ways. some of the most well studied functions of group i mglurs, such as initiation of multiple forms of mglur-dependent long-term depression, require receptor localization near the post-synaptic density (psd). this localization is in turn dependent on the homer family of scaffolding proteins which bind to a small motif on the distal c-termini of mglur1 and 5, localize the receptors near the psd, strengthen coupling to post-synaptic effectors and simultaneously uncouple the mglurs from extra-synaptic effectors such as voltage dependent ion channels. here the selectivity of this uncoupling process was examined by testing the ability of homer-2b to uncouple mglur1 from multiple voltage dependent calcium channels including ca(v2.2) (n-type), ca(v3.2) (t-type), and ca(v2.1) (p/q-type) expressed in rat sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion (scg). of these, only the mglur1-ca(v2.1) modulatory pathway was insensitive to homer-2b expression. uncoupling from this channel was achieved by co-expression of an mglur1 c-terminal protein designed to disrupt a previously described direct interaction between these two proteins, suggesting that this interaction allows incorporation of ca(v2.1) into the mglur1/homer signaling complex, thereby preserving modulation in the presence of scaffolding homer proteins. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'metabotropic glutamate receptors'.	@norel@
dose-dependent effects of vitamin d on transdifferentiation of skeletal muscle cells to adipose cells. fat infiltration within muscle is one of a number of features of vitamin d deficiency, which leads to a decline in muscle functionality. the origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it forms from myogenic precursor cells present in the muscle, which transdifferentiate into mature adipocytes. the current study examined the effect of the active form of vitamin d₃, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d₃ (1,25(oh)₂d₃), on the capacity of the c2c12 muscle cell line to differentiate towards the myogenic and adipogenic lineages. cells were cultured in myogenic or adipogenic differentiation media containing increasing concentrations (0, 10⁻¹³, 10⁻¹¹, 10⁻⁹, 10⁻⁷ or 10⁻⁵  m) of 1,25(oh)₂d₃ for up to 6 days and markers of muscle and fat development measured. mature myofibres were formed in both adipogenic and myogenic media, but fat droplets were only observed in adipogenic media. relative to controls, low physiological concentrations (10⁻¹³ and 10⁻¹¹  m) of 1,25(oh)₂d3 increased fat droplet accumulation, whereas high physiological (10⁻⁹  m) and supraphysiological concentrations (≥10⁻⁷  m) inhibited fat accumulation. this increased accumulation of fat with low physiological concentrations (10⁻¹³ and 10⁻¹¹  m) was associated with a sequential up-regulation of pparγ2 (pparg) and fabp4 mrna, indicating formation of adipocytes, whereas higher concentrations (≥10⁻⁹  m) reduced all these effects, and the highest concentration (10⁻⁵  m) appeared to have toxic effects. this is the first study to demonstrate dose-dependent effects of 1,25(oh)₂d₃ on the transdifferentiation of muscle cells into adipose cells. low physiological concentrations (possibly mimicking a deficient state) induced adipogenesis, whereas higher (physiological and supraphysiological) concentrations attenuated this effect.	@norel@
erod activity induction in peripheral blood lymphocytes, liver and brain tissues of rats orally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. little is known in terms of multi-matrix cytochrome p450 activity induction under repeated oral exposure to planar halogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (phh, pah). in the present study, 60 rats were daily exposed, during 28days, to oral ingestion of a mixture consisting of phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene at 0, 6 or 600μg/day. erod activity, reflecting almost exclusively cyp1a1 and cyp1b1 activities, was measured in brain and liver microsomes as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). all induction kinetics could be appropriately fitted using logistic-like models. after 28days of exposure to a 6μg/day dose, erod activity was found to be 91, 152 and 94-fold increased in lymphocytes, liver and brain, respectively, compared to day 0. plateau activities could be appropriately fitted versus ingested doses using hill or michaelis-menten models. correlations between matrices made it possible to conclude that erod activity in pbl should be considered as a sensitive, convenient and non-destructive approach for (i) evaluating erod activity in liver, which was found to represent 98% of the observed erod activities in the three tested matrices and (ii) evaluating oral exposure of homogeneous groups of farm animals (race, diet) to cyp inducing pah and phh.	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @chemical@ erod @gene@ @cpr:3@ halogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @chemical@ cytochrome p450 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pah @chemical@ cytochrome p450 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
loperamide, an opiate analog, differently modifies the adrenocorticotropin responses to corticotropin-releasing hormone and lysine vasopressin in patients with addison's disease. loperamide is a peripheral opiate agonist able to inhibit acth secretion. in this work, the interactions between loperamide and two acth secretagogues, lysine vasopressin (lvp) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh), were investigated in patients with addison's disease. after loperamide (16 mg orally) or placebo administration, 5 patients received lvp (0.06 iu/kg i.v. over 1 h) and 6 patients received ocrh (1 micrograms/kg i.v. as bolus). in all patients loperamide induced a significant fall in plasma acth levels. lvp increased acth levels after both loperamide (from 48 +/- 17.3 to a peak of 95 +/- 21 pmol/l) and placebo (from 231 +/- 59.5 to 365 +/- 86.6 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was not significant. crh caused a rise in plasma acth after both loperamide (from 30 +/- 16.6 to a peak of 108 +/- 31 pmol/l) and placebo (from 98.5 +/- 47 to 211 +/- 61.7 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was significant, and the first phase of crh-induced acth secretion was significantly lower after loperamide. these data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of lvp and crh on acth secretion: namely, lvp and loperamide act in an additive manner, while crh and loperamide interact in a non additive way. although these findings might be explained by the involvement of different intracellular acth-secreting mechanisms, an influence of loperamide on some suprapituitary factors modulating the acth response is suggested.	loperamide @chemical@ crh @gene@ @cpr:4@ loperamide @chemical@ acth @gene@ @cpr:4@ loperamide @chemical@ acth @gene@ @cpr:4@ loperamide @chemical@ acth @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
biosynthetic regulation and intracellular transport of phosphatidylserine in mammalian cells. in mammalian cells, phosphatidylserine (ptdser) is synthesized through the action of the endoplasmic reticulum enzymes, ptdser synthase 1 and 2, and the decarboxylation of ptdser accounts for the majority of phosphatidylethanolamine (ptdetn) synthesis. ptdser decarboxylation for ptdetn formation occurs in the mitochondria. in addition, the transport of ptdser from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria is probably a rate limiting step for ptdetn synthesis through the decarboxylation pathway. therefore, the regulation of ptdser synthesis and its intracellular transport appear to be essential events for the maintenance of normal cellular ptdser and ptdetn levels. here we describe the current understanding of the regulation of ptdser biosynthesis and the transport of ptdser from the er to the mitochondria in mammalian cells.	@norel@
pharmacological characterization of unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney. in human kidney, we found unique prazosin-binding sites that were insensitive to phentolamine and were thus unlikely to be alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. as the binding of [(3)h]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites was prevented by 100 microm guanabenz, the insensitive sites were evaluated by subtracting [(3)h]prazosin binding in the presence of 100 microm guanabenz from that in the presence of 10 microm phentolamine. [(3)h]prazosin bound to the phentolamine-insensitive sites monophasically with a high affinity (pk(d); 9.1+/-0.08, n=8), and the b(max) value (814+/-204 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=8) was more than ten times that of the phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (pk(d)=9.9+/-0.13, b(max)=66+/-23 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=7). the phentolamine-insensitive sites in human kidney were highly sensitive to other quinazoline derivatives such as terazosin and doxazosin. however, other alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists (tamsulosin, wb4101 and corynanthine) did not inhibit the binding at a range of concentrations that generally exhibit alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism, and noradrenaline, rauwolscine and propranolol were without effect on the [(3)h]prazosin binding. on the other hand, ligands for the renal na(+)-transporter (amiloride and triamterene) and for imidazoline recognition sites (guanabenz, guanfacine and agmatine) displaced the binding of [(3)h]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites at micromolar concentrations. photoaffinity labeling with [(125)i]iodoarylazidoprazosin showed phentolamine-insensitive labeling at around 100 kda, a molecular size larger than that of human alpha(1a)- and alpha(1b)-adrenoceptors expressed in 293 cells (50-60 and 70-80 kda, respectively) on electrophoresis. in contrast, there was no detectable phentolamine-insensitive binding site but were phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in human liver (pk(d)=10.0+/-0.06, b(max)=44+/-6 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=3). phentolamine-insensitive prazosin binding sites were also detected in rabbit kidney (approximately 50% of specific binding sites) but were minor in rat kidney (less than 20%). in conclusion, there are unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney, the pharmacological profiles of which were distinct from those of known adrenoceptors.	tamsulosin @chemical@ alpha(1)-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ wb4101 @chemical@ alpha(1)-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ corynanthine @chemical@ alpha(1)-adrenoceptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
cooperative homotropic interaction of l-noradrenaline with the catalytic site of phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase. catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine) are potent inhibitors of phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase (phenylalanine hydroxylase, ec 1.14.16.1). the amines bind to the enzyme by a direct coordination to the high-spin (s = 5/2) fe(iii) at the active site (charge transfer interaction), as seen by resonance raman and epr spectroscopy. experimental evidence is presented that a group with an apparent pka value of about 5.1 (20 degrees c) is involved in the interaction between the catecholamine and the enzyme. the high-affinity binding of l-noradrenaline to phenylalanine hydroxylase, as studied by equilibrium microdialysis (anaerobically) and ultrafiltration (aerobically), shows positive cooperativity (h = 1.9); at ph 7.2 and 20 degrees c the rat enzyme binds about 0.5 mol l-noradrenaline/mol subunit with a half-maximal binding (s50) at 0.25 microm l-noradrenaline. no binding to the ferrous form of the enzyme was observed. the affinity decreases with decreasing ph, by phosphorylation and by preincubation of the enzyme with the substrate l-phenylalanine, while it increases after alkylation of the enzyme with the activator n-ethylmaleimide. preincubation of the enzyme with l-phenylalanine also leads to a complete loss of the cooperativity of l-noradrenaline binding (h = 1.0). the many similarities in binding properties of the inhibitor l-noradrenaline and the activator/substrate l-phenylalanine makes it likely that the cooperative interactions of these effectors are due to their binding to the same site. the high-affinity of catecholamines to phenylalanine hydroxylase is a valuable probe to study the active site of this enzyme and is also relevant for the homologous enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is purified as a stable catecholamine-fe(iii) complex.	adrenaline @chemical@ phenylalanine hydroxylase @gene@ @cpr:4@ adrenaline @chemical@ ec 1.14.16.1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ adrenaline @chemical@ phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ noradrenaline @chemical@ phenylalanine hydroxylase @gene@ @cpr:4@ noradrenaline @chemical@ ec 1.14.16.1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ noradrenaline @chemical@ phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ dopamine @chemical@ phenylalanine hydroxylase @gene@ @cpr:4@ dopamine @chemical@ ec 1.14.16.1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dopamine @chemical@ phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ catecholamines @chemical@ phenylalanine hydroxylase @gene@ @cpr:4@ catecholamines @chemical@ ec 1.14.16.1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ catecholamines @chemical@ phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the decrease of catalase or esterase d activity in patients with microdeletions of 11p or 13q does not increase their radiosensitivity. lymphocyte cultures from patients affected by retinoblastoma (rb), with or without a microdeletion of chromosome 13, and wilms tumor (wt), with a microdeletion of chromosome 11p where exposed to gamma-ray radiation during s and g2 phases. chromatid and chromosome lesions were scored and compared to those observed in controls. no significant differences were detected, neither between patients and controls, nor between patients carrying or not a microdeletion. this lack of difference was unexpected since the genes for catalase and esterase d, also called s-formyl glutathione hydrolase, which are two detoxication enzymes, are deleted in case of microdeletion of 11p and 13q, respectively.	@norel@
enzyme expression profiles suggest the novel tumor-activated fluoropyrimidine carbamate capecitabine (xeloda) might be effective against papillary thyroid cancers of children and young adults. purpose: the fluoropyrimidine carbamate (capecitabine) is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) by thymidine phosphorylase (tp) inside target tissues. 5-fu interferes with dna synthesis by blocking thymidylate synthase (ts) but is inactivated by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dpd). favorable enzyme profiles (high tp and low dpd) generate high intratumor levels of 5-fu that are effective against many tumors, especially those with low ts. capecitabine has not been tested against thyroid cancers, and it is not known to what extent thyroid cancers express tp, ts or dpd. methods: to test this, we determined tp, ts and dpd in 19 thyroid cancers from young patients (14 papillary, 4 follicular, 1 medullary) by immunohistochemistry. after approval by the human use committee, the intensity of tp, ts, and dpd staining was determined by two independent examiners and graded (absent=0 to intense=3) with >90% concordance. results: ts was detected in 7/19 cancers (37%), tp in 14/19 cancers (74%) and dpd in 14/19 cancers (74%). in six tumors, tp was more intense that dpd, suggesting capecitabine sensitivity. only five tumors failed to express tp but four of these expressed dpd, suggesting capecitabine resistance. overall, 6/19 tumors (32% of the total) had a favorable expression profile, and all of them were papillary cancers. conclusions: we conclude that the majority of differentiated thyroid cancers (74%) express tp and low levels of ts (63% undetectable). the results support the hypothesis that capecitabine is activated in the majority of differentiated thyroid cancers and that 32% have favorable expression of all three enzymes (tp, ts, and dpd).	5-fu @chemical@ thymidylate synthase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 5-fu @chemical@ ts @gene@ @cpr:4@ 5-fluorouracil @chemical@ tp @gene@ @cpr:9@ 5-fluorouracil @chemical@ thymidine phosphorylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 5-fu @chemical@ tp @gene@ @cpr:9@ 5-fu @chemical@ thymidine phosphorylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 5-fu @chemical@ tp @gene@ @cpr:9@ 5-fu @chemical@ dpd @gene@ @cpr:9@ fluoropyrimidine carbamate @chemical@ tp @gene@ @cpr:9@ fluoropyrimidine carbamate @chemical@ thymidine phosphorylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ capecitabine @chemical@ tp @gene@ @cpr:9@ capecitabine @chemical@ thymidine phosphorylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
inhibitory effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the vesicular monoamine transporter 2. the neuronal vesicular monoamine transporter (vmat2) is the target molecule of action of some psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (mdma). the present study examined the effect of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), on vmat2 activity by measuring adenosine triphosphate-dependent [(3)h]dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles prepared from rat striatum. ssris, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine, inhibited vesicular [(3)h]dopamine uptake in vitro. the rank order of potency was reserpine>>fluoxetine, paroxetine>fluvoxamine, methamphetamine>mdma. moreover, kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition by reserpine, a typical vmat2 inhibitor, was uncompetitive, decreasing maximum velocity and affinity for dopamine. inhibition by fluoxetine was noncompetitive, only decreasing maximum velocity for dopamine. these results suggest that fluoxetine inhibited the activity of vmat2 by a mechanism different from that of reserpine and did not directly interact with the active site of vmat2.	reserpine @chemical@ vmat2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ reserpine @chemical@ vmat2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fluoxetine @chemical@ vmat2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fluoxetine @chemical@ vmat2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dopamine @chemical@ vmat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ [(3)h]dopamine @chemical@ vmat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
antipsychotic profile of rolipram: efficacy in rats and reduced sensitivity in mice deficient in the phosphodiesterase-4b (pde4b) enzyme. rationale: recent studies provide evidence for reduced phosphodiesterase-4b (pde4b) as a genetic susceptibility factor as well as suggesting an association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in pde4b that are associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia. objectives: the aim of the current study was to assess the activity of rolipram, a nonsubtype-selective pde4 inhibitor, in several animal models predictive of antipsychotic-like efficacy and side-effect liability and to use pde4b wild-type and knockout mice to begin to understand the subtypes involved in the activity of rolipram. results: in rats, rolipram antagonized both phencyclidine hydrochloride- and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and inhibited conditioned avoidance responding (car). in pde4b wild-type mice, rolipram dose-dependently suppressed car (ed(50) = 2.4 mg/kg); however, in knockout mice, their sensitivity to rolipram at the higher doses (1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg) was reduced, resulting in a threefold shift in the ed(50) (7.3 mg/kg), suggesting pde4b is involved, at least in part, with the activity of rolipram. only the highest dose of rolipram (3.2 mg/kg) produced a modest but significant degree of catalepsy. conclusions: rolipram has a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the atypical antipsychotics and has low extrapyramidal symptom liability. these results suggest that pde4b mediates the antipsychotic effects of rolipram in car and that the pde4b-regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway may play a role in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychosis.	rolipram @chemical@ pde4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ cyclic adenosine monophosphate @chemical@ pde4b @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
neurochemical control of rapid stress-induced changes in brain aromatase activity. in the male brain, the medial preoptic nucleus (pom) is known to be a critical relay for the activation of sexual behaviour, with the aromatisation of testosterone into 17β-oestradiol (e2 ) playing a key role. acute stress has been shown to differentially modulate the aromatase enzyme in this and other brain nuclei in a sex-specific manner. in pom specifically, stress induces increases in aromatase activity (aa) that are both rapid and reversible. how the physiological processes initiated during an acute stress response mediate sex- and nuclei- specific changes in aa and which stress response hormones are involved remains to be determined. by examining the relative effects of corticosterone (cort), arginine vasotocin (avt, the avian homologue to arginine vasopressin) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf), the present study aimed to define the hormone profile regulating stress-induced increases in aa in the pom. we found that cort, avt and crf all appear to play some role in these changes in the male brain. in addition, these effects occur in a targeted manner, such that modulation of the enzyme by these hormones only occurs in the pom rather than in all aromatase-expressing nuclei. similarly, in the female brain, the experimental effects were restricted to the pom but only crf was capable of inducing the stress-like increases in aa. these data further demonstrate the high degree of specificity (nuclei-, sex- and hormone-specific effects) in this system, highlighting the complexity of the stress-aromatase link and suggesting modes through which the nongenomic modulation of this enzyme can result in targeted, rapid changes in local oestrogen concentrations.	@norel@
a multitargeted, metronomic, and maximum-tolerated dose "chemo-switch" regimen is antiangiogenic, producing objective responses and survival benefit in a mouse model of cancer. purpose: a transgenic mouse model has revealed parameters of the angiogenic switch during multistep tumorigenesis of pancreatic islets, and demonstrated efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies. pericytes have been revealed as functionally important for tumor neovasculature, using kinase inhibitors targeting their platelet-derived growth factor receptors (pdgfrs). additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr) inhibitors and metronomic chemotherapy show modest benefit against early- but not late-stage disease. materials and methods: seeking to improve efficacy against otherwise intractable end-stage pancreatic islet tumors, two receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and su11248, were used to disrupt pdgfr-mediated pericyte support of tumor endothelial cells in concert with maximum-tolerated dose (mtd) or metronomic chemotherapy and/or vegfr inhibition. results: imatinib, despite equivocal efficacy as monotherapy, reduced pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and enhanced efficacy in combination with metronomic chemotherapy or vegfr inhibition. a regimen involving all three was even better. mtd using cyclophosphamide caused transitory regression, but then rapid regrowth, in contrast to metronomic cyclophosphamide plus imatinib, which produced stable disease. the mtd regimen elicited apoptosis of tumor cells but not endothelial cells, whereas the other regimens increased endothelial cell apoptosis concordant with efficacy. a "chemo-switch" protocol, involving sequential mtd and then metronomic chemotherapy, overlaid with multitargeted inhibition of pdgfr and vegfr, gave complete responses and unprecedented survival advantage in this model. conclusion: this study demonstrates a potentially tractable clinical strategy in a stringent preclinical model, wherein standard-of-care chemotherapy is followed by a novel maintenance regimen: pdfgr is targeted to disrupt pericyte support, while metronomic chemotherapy and/or vegfr inhibitors target consequently sensitized endothelial cells, collectively destabilizing pre-existing tumor vasculature and inhibiting ongoing angiogenesis.	imatinib @chemical@ receptor tyrosine kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ pdgfr @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ vegfr @gene@ @cpr:4@ su11248 @chemical@ receptor tyrosine kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ su11248 @chemical@ pdgfr @gene@ @cpr:4@ su11248 @chemical@ vegfr @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ vegfr @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
use of the combination index to determine interactions between plant-derived phenolic acids on hepatotoxicity endpoints in human and rat hepatoma cells. the beneficial or adverse effects of isolated phytochemicals are not always concordant with effects of the botanical dietary supplements from which they were derived. this disparity could be due to interactions between the various phytochemicals present in the whole plant. the phenolic acids, rosmarinic acid (ra), caffeic acid (ca) and ferulic acid (fa) are widely present in foods and dietary supplements, and they are assumed to exert various beneficial biological effects. however, there is little data on the potential biological interactions of these three phenolic acids which commonly occur together and are linked metabolically. in the present study, liver toxicity of the three phenolic acids was assessed on the three compounds singly and in various binary and one ternary combinations. a series of in vitro endpoints relevant to liver toxicity were evaluated in both a human (hepg2/c3a) and rat (mh1c1) hepatocyte cell line. the combination index (ci) was calculated for each endpoint from both the concentration responses of the single compounds and the responses of the various binary and ternary mixtures. both synergistic and antagonistic interactions were observed for some endpoints and some combinations of test agents. interactions were most prevalent in measures of oxidative stress and cytochrome p450 activities in both cell types. there was only a 53% concordance between the rat and human cells which may be suggestive of species differences. the data suggest an approach for better characterizing the beneficial or adverse effects of complex botanical products through evaluation of interactions between individual phytochemical components.	@norel@
peroxynitrite mediates testosterone-induced vasodilation of microvascular resistance vessels. our knowledge of how androgens influence the cardiovascular system is far from complete, and this lack of understanding is especially true of how androgens affect resistance vessels. our aim was to identify the signaling mechanisms stimulated by testosterone (tes) in microvascular arteries and to understand how these mechanisms mediate tes-induced vasodilation. mesenteric microvessels were isolated from male sprague-dawley rats. tension studies demonstrated a rapid, concentration-dependent, vasodilatory response to tes that did not involve protein synthesis or aromatization to 17β-estradiol. dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and nitrotyrosine immunoblot experiments indicated that tes stimulated peroxynitrite formation in microvessels, and functional studies demonstrated that tes-induced vasodilation was inhibited by scavenging peroxynitrite. as predicted, tes enhanced the production of both peroxynitrite precursors (i.e., superoxide and nitic oxide), and xanthine oxidase was identified as the likely source of tes-stimulated superoxide production. functional and biochemical studies indicated that tes signaling involved activity of the phosphoinositide 3 (pi3) kinase-protein kinase b (akt) cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor and culminated in enhanced production of cgmp and microvascular vasodilation. these findings, derived from a variety of analytical and functional approaches, provide evidence for a novel nongenomic signaling mechanism for androgen action in the microvasculature: tes-stimulated vasodilation mediated primarily by peroxynitrite formed from xanthine oxidase-generated superoxide and no. this response was associated with activation of the pi3 kinase-akt signaling cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor. we propose this mechanism could account for tes-stimulated cgmp production in microvessels and, ultimately, vasodilation.	tes @chemical@ androgen receptor @gene@ @cpr:3@ peroxynitrite @chemical@ xanthine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:9@ superoxide @chemical@ xanthine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:9@ no @chemical@ xanthine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:9@ tes @chemical@ xanthine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:9@ superoxide @chemical@ xanthine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
role of tachykinin and bradykinin receptors and mast cells in gaseous formaldehyde-induced airway microvascular leakage in rats. we have investigated the effects of cp-99,994 [(+)-(2s,3s)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine], a tachykinin nk1 receptor antagonist, hoe 140 (d-arg[hyp3,thi5,d-tic7,oic8]bradykinin), a bradykinin b2 receptor antagonist, and ketotifen (4-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)4 h-benzo[4,5]cycloheptal[1,2-b]thiophen-10(9h)-one hydrogen fumarate), a histamine h1 receptor antagonist with mast cell-stabilizing properties, on microvascular leakage induced by gaseous formaldehyde. extravasation of evans blue dye into airway tissues was used as an index of airway microvascular leakage. leakage of dye in the trachea and main bronchi increased significantly in a concentration-dependent fashion after 10 min inhalation of formaldehyde (5-45 parts per million (ppm)). the airway response induced by 10 min inhalation of 15 ppm formaldehyde (trachea: 119.5 +/- 13.9 ng/mg, n = 7; main bronchi: 139.6 +/- 7.9 ng/mg, n = 7) was abolished by the administration of cp-99,994 (3 and 6 mg/kg i.v.), but not by the administration of hoe 140 (0.65 mg/kg i.v.) nor ketotifen (1 mg/kg i.v.). the increase in vascular permeability induced by formaldehyde in the rat airway was mediated predominantly by nk1 receptor stimulation. activation of bradykinin receptors and mast cells did not appear to play an important role in this airway response.	cp-99,994 @chemical@ tachykinin nk1 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ [(+)-(2s,3s)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine] @chemical@ tachykinin nk1 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ hoe 140 @chemical@ bradykinin b2 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ (d-arg[hyp3,thi5,d-tic7,oic8]bradykinin) @chemical@ bradykinin b2 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ ketotifen @chemical@ histamine h1 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ (4-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)4 h-benzo[4,5]cycloheptal[1,2-b]thiophen-10(9h)-one hydrogen fumarate) @chemical@ histamine h1 receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
potent fibrinolysis inhibitor discovered by shape and electrostatic complementarity to the drug tranexamic acid. protein-protein interfaces provide an important class of drug targets currently receiving increased attention. the typical design strategy to inhibit protein-protein interactions usually involves large molecules such as peptides and macrocycles. one exception is tranexamic acid (txa), which, as a lysine mimetic, inhibits binding of plasminogen to fibrin. however, the daily dose of txa is high due to its modest potency and pharmacokinetic properties. in this study, we report a computational approach, where the focus was on finding electrostatic potential similarities to txa. coupling this computational technique with a high-quality low-throughput screen identified 5-(4-piperidyl)-3-isoxazolol (4-piol) as a potent plasminogen binding inhibitor with the potential for the treatment of various bleeding disorders. remarkably, 4-piol was found to be more than four times as potent as the drug txa.	tranexamic acid @chemical@ plasminogen @gene@ @cpr:4@ tranexamic acid @chemical@ fibrin @gene@ @cpr:4@ txa @chemical@ plasminogen @gene@ @cpr:4@ txa @chemical@ fibrin @gene@ @cpr:4@ lysine @chemical@ plasminogen @gene@ @cpr:4@ lysine @chemical@ fibrin @gene@ @cpr:4@ 5-(4-piperidyl)-3-isoxazolol @chemical@ plasminogen @gene@ @cpr:4@ 4-piol @chemical@ plasminogen @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
medical treatment of acute poisoning with organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides. organophosphorus compounds (ops) are used as pesticides and developed as warfare nerve agents such as tabun, soman, sarin, vx and others. exposure to even small amounts of an op can be fatal and death is usually caused by respiratory failure. the mechanism of op poisoning involves inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ache) leading to inactivation of the enzyme which has an important role in neurotransmission. ache inhibition results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the nervous systems. during more than five decades, pyridinium oximes have been developed as therapeutic agents used in the medical treatment of poisoning with op. they act by reactivation of ache inhibited by op. however, they differ in their activity in poisoning with pesticides and warfare nerve agents and there is still no universal broad-spectrum oxime capable of protecting against all known op. in spite of enormous efforts devoted to development of new pyridinium oximes as potential antidotes against poisoning with op only four compounds so far have found its application in human medicine. presently, a combination of an antimuscarinic agent, e.g. atropine, ache reactivator such as one of the recommended pyridinium oximes (pralidoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime and hi-6) and diazepam are used for the treatment of op poisoning in humans. in this article the available data related to medical treatment of poisoning with op pesticides are reviewed and the current recommendations are presented.	trimedoxime @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:3@ obidoxime @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:3@ hi-6 @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:3@ diazepam @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:3@ atropine @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:3@ pyridinium oximes @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:3@ pralidoxime @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:3@ op @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:4@ op @chemical@ acetylcholinesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ op @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:4@ op @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
tryptophan hydroxylase mrna levels are elevated by repeated immobilization stress in rat raphe nuclei but not in pineal gland. repeated stress triggers a wide range of adaptive changes in the central nervous system including the elevation of serotonin (5-ht) metabolism and an increased susceptibility to affective disorders. to begin to examine whether these changes are mediated by alterations in gene expression for tryptophan hydroxylase (tph), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-ht biosynthesis, we quantitated its mrna levels by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). repeated immobilization stress (2 h, 7 days) elicited a six- or ten-fold rise in tph mrna in median raphe nucleus (mrn) and dorsal raphe nucleus (drn), respectively, without significantly altering tph mrna levels in the pineal gland. in contrast, there was little change in mrna levels for gtp cyclohydrolase i (gtpch), the rate limiting enzyme in synthesis of the tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), the obligate cofactor for tph. this is the first study to reveal stress-elicited activation of tph gene expression.	5-ht @chemical@ tryptophan hydroxylase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 5-ht @chemical@ tph @gene@ @cpr:9@ tetrahydrobiopterin @chemical@ gtp cyclohydrolase i @gene@ @cpr:9@ tetrahydrobiopterin @chemical@ gtpch @gene@ @cpr:9@ bh4 @chemical@ gtp cyclohydrolase i @gene@ @cpr:9@ bh4 @chemical@ gtpch @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
functional consequences of the arrhythmogenic g306r kvlqt1 k+ channel mutant probed by viral gene transfer in cardiomyocytes. iks, the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, figures prominently in the repolarization of heart cells. the k+ channel gene kvlqt1 is mutated in the heritable long qt (lqt) syndrome. heterologous coexpression of kvlqt1 and the accessory protein mink yields an iks-like current. nevertheless, the links between kvlqt1 and cardiac iks are largely inferential. since the lqt syndrome mutant kvlqt1-g306r suppresses channel activity when coexpressed with wild-type kvlqt1 in a heterologous system, overexpression of this mutant in cardiomyocytes should reduce or eliminate native iks if kvlqt1 is indeed the major molecular component of this current. to test this idea, we created the adenovirus adrmgi-kvlqt1-g306r, which overexpresses kvlqt1-g306r channels. in > 60 % of neonatal mouse myocytes, a sizable iks could be measured using perforated-patch recordings (8.0 +/- 1.6 pa pf-1, n = 13). iks was increased by forskolin and blocked by clofilium or indapamide but not by e-4031. while cells infected with a reporter virus expressing only green fluorescent protein (gfp) displayed iks similar to that in uninfected cells, adrmgi-kvlqt1-g306r-infected cells showed a significantly reduced iks (2.4 +/- 1.1 pa pf-1, n = 10, p < 0.01) when measured 60-72 h after infection. similar results were observed in adult guinea-pig myocytes (5.9 +/- 1.2 pa pf-1, n = 9, for control vs. 0.1 +/- 0.1 pa pf-1, n = 5, for adrmgi-kvlqt1-g306r-infected cells). we conclude that kvlqt1 is the major molecular component of iks. our results further establish a dominant-negative mechanism for the g306r lqt syndrome mutation.	@norel@
warfarin dose and the pharmacogenomics of cyp2c9 and vkorc1 - rationale and perspectives. warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant, but there is greater than 10-fold interindividual variability in the dose required to attain a therapeutic response. information from pharmacogenomics, the study of the interaction of an individual's genotype and drug response, can help optimize drug efficacy while minimizing adverse drug reactions. pharmacogenetic analysis of two genes, the warfarin metabolic enzyme cyp2c9 and warfarin target enzyme, vitamin k epoxide reductase complex 1 vkorc1, confirmed their influence on warfarin maintenance dose. possession of cyp2c9*2 or cyp2c9*3 variant alleles, which result in decreased enzyme activity, is associated with a significant decrease in the mean warfarin dose. several single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in vkorc1 are associated with warfarin dose across the normal dose range. haplotypes based on these snps explain a large fraction of the interindividual variation in warfarin dose, and vkorc1 has an approximately three-fold greater effect than cyp2c9. algorithms incorporating genetic (cyp2c9 and vkorc1), demographic, and clinical factors to estimate the warfarin dosage, could potentially minimize the risk of over dose during warfarin induction.	warfarin @chemical@ cyp2c9 @gene@ @cpr:9@ warfarin @chemical@ cyp2c9 @gene@ @cpr:9@ warfarin @chemical@ cyp2c9 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
p2y12, a new platelet adp receptor, target of clopidogrel. clopidogrel is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits adp-induced platelet aggregation. the results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. the antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of adp binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. the chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; p2x (1), a calcium channel, and p2y1 a gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. another gi (2)-coupled receptor (named p2y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in cho cells. these cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)p-2mes-adp, a stable analogue of adp, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. the binding of (33)p-2mes-adp to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. in these transfected cho cells, as in platelets, adp and 2mes-adp induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. these results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called "p2t" platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of adp on platelets.	@norel@
bioactive phenolics from seriphidium stenocephalum. chromatographic separation of the ethyl acetate soluble part of the methanolic extract from seriphidium stenocephalum yielded three new compounds: stenocepflavone (1), stenocepflavan (2), and stenocephol (3), together with cirsimaritin (4), 5,7,5'-trihydroxy-3',4',6-trimethoxyflavone (5), 5,6,7,5'-tetrahydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone (6), and axillaroside (7). all isolates were characterized with the help of spectroscopic data including 1d, 2d nmr, and high resolution mass spectrometry and/or in comparison with the related compounds in literature. all compounds were tested for in vitro enzyme inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and lipoxygenase. compounds 1 and 4-7 exhibited significant activity against all the tested enzymes, whereas compounds 2 and 3 were found inactive.	@norel@
control of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis using the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid sequence of the translocator protein tspo. the translocator protein (18-kda) tspo is an ubiquitous high affinity cholesterol-binding protein reported to be present in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels; its expression dramatically increased in macrophages found in atherosclerotic plaques. a domain in the carboxy-terminus of tspo was identified and characterized as the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (crac). the ability of the crac domain to bind to cholesterol led us to hypothesize that this peptide could be used as an hypocholesterolemic, with potential anti-atherogenic properties, agent. we report herein the therapeutic benefit that resulted for the administration of the vlnyyvwr human crac sequence to guinea pigs fed with a high cholesterol diet and apoe knock-out b6.129p2-apoetm1unc/j mice. crac treatment (3 and 30mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks) resulted in reduced circulating cholesterol levels in guinea pigs fed with 2% high cholesterol diet and apoe knock-out b6.129p2-apoetm1unc/j mice. in high cholesterol fed guinea pigs, crac treatment administered once daily induced an increase in circulating hdl, decreased total, free and ldl cholesterol, and removed atheroma deposits in the aorta in a dose-dependent manner. the treatment also prevented the high cholesterol diet-induced increase in serum creatine kinase, total and isoforms, markers of neurological, cardiac and muscular damage. no toxicity was observed. taken together these results support a role of tspo in lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis and indicate that crac may constitute a novel and safe treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.	cholesterol @chemical@ creatine kinase @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
concentration-dependent inhibitory effects of baicalin on the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a dual probe of cyp2d and cyp3a, in rats. baicalin has been shown to possess many pharmacological effects, including antiviral, antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. in the current study, we reveal the inhibitory effects of baicalin on the metabolism of dextromethorphan (dxm), a dual probe substrate of cyp2d and cyp3a, in rats. lineweaver-burk plots demonstrated that baicalin inhibited the activities of cyp2d and cyp3a in a non-competitive manner in rat liver microsomes (rlms). concomitant administration of baicalin (0.90g/kg, i.v.) and dxm (10mg/kg, i.v.) increased the maximum drug concentration (cmax) (37%) and the area under concentration-time curve (auc) (42%) and decreased the clearance (cl) (27%) of dxm in a randomised, crossover study in rats (p<0.01). the change in the auc of dxm was significantly correlated with the cmax and auc of baicalin (p<0.05). the inhibitory effects of multiple doses of baicalin (0.90g/kg, i.v., 12days) on the metabolism of dxm were similar to those observed following a single dose in rats. the activity of cyp3a in excised liver samples from rats following multiple baicalin treatment was significantly decreased compared to that of the control group (p<0.05), whereas multiple doses of baicalin had no obvious effect on the activity of cyp2d. taken together, these data demonstrate that baicalin inhibits the metabolism of dxm in a concentration-dependent manner in rats, possibly through inhibiting hepatic cyp2d and cyp3a activities.	baicalin @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:4@ baicalin @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:4@ dextromethorphan @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:9@ dextromethorphan @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:9@ dxm @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:9@ dxm @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:9@ dextromethorphan @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:9@ dextromethorphan @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:9@ dxm @chemical@ cyp2d @gene@ @cpr:9@ dxm @chemical@ cyp3a @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
role of nitric oxide in the chemistry and anticancer activity of etoposide (vp-16,213). originally identified as an innate cytotoxin, nitric oxide ((·)no) formation in tumors can influence chemotherapy and exacerbate cancer progression. here, we examined the hypothesis that (·)no generation contributes to cancer cell drug resistance toward the widely used anticancer drug etoposide (vp-16). the uv-vis spectrum of vp-16 was not changed by exposure of vp-16 to (·)no in aqueous buffer. in contrast, reddish-orange compound(s) characteristic of o-quinone- and nitroso-vp-16 were readily generated in a hydrophobic medium (chloroform) in an oxygen-dependent manner. similar products were also formed when the vp-16 radical, generated from vp-16 and horseradish peroxidase/h2o2, was exposed directly to (·)no in chloroform in the presence of oxygen. separation and spectral analysis of vp-16 reaction extracts by electron spin resonance and uv-vis indicated the generation of the phenoxy radical and the o-quinone of vp-16, as well as putative nitroxide, iminoxyl, and other nitrogen oxide intermediates. nitric oxide products of vp-16 displayed significantly diminished topoisomerase ii-dependent cleavage of dna and cytotoxicity to human hl-60 leukemia cells. lps-mediated induction of nitric oxide synthase in murine macrophages resulted in vp-16 resistance compared to raw cells. furthermore, (·)no products derived from inos rapidly reacted with vp-16 leading to decreased dna damage and cytotoxicity. together, these observations suggest that the formation of (·)no in tumors (associated macrophages) can contribute to vp-16 resistance via the detoxification of vp-16.	vp-16 @chemical@ topoisomerase ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
synthesis, characterization and targeting potential of zidovudine loaded sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers. the present investigation was aimed at exploring dual targeting of anti-hiv drug, zidovudine (zdv) via sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated poly(propyleneimine) (ppi) dendritic nano-constructs. fourth generation ppi dendrimers, sialic acid conjugated ppi dendrimers (sppi), mannose conjugated ppi dendrimers (mppi) and dual ligand system i.e. sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated ppi dendrimers (smppi) were synthesized and characterized by ft-ir and (1)h nmr spectroscopies and were further confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry. various parameters like drug loading, ph dependent in vitro release, hemolytic toxicity, macrophage uptake and cytotoxicity concerning ppi, sppi, mppi and smppi dendrimers were evaluated. zdv loaded smppi, sppi and mppi have shown reduced hemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity and in vitro drug release at ph 7.4. extremely significant (p<0.001) increase in cellular uptake of zdv by macrophage cells was observed in case of smppi as compared to ppi and free drug. the in vivo blood level and tissue distribution studies in albino rats also demonstrated potential of dual targeted system towards sialoadhesin and carbohydrate receptors. the drug concentration in lymph nodes was increased to about 28 times in case of smppi (1335 ± 17.6 ng/g) as compared to free drug (48 ± 5.8 ng/g) at 6th hr. the results suggested that such dual ligand dendritic system (smppi) hold potential to enhance biocompatibility and site specific delivery of antiretroviral drug, zdv.	@norel@
resistin knockout mice exhibit impaired adipocyte glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (gipr) expression. glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) is an incretin hormone that also plays a regulatory role in fat metabolism. in 3t3-l1 cells, resistin was demonstrated to be a key mediator of gip stimulation of lipoprotein lipase (lpl) activity, involving activation of protein kinase b (pkb) and reduced phosphorylation of liver kinase b1 (lkb1) and amp-activated protein kinase (ampk). the current study was initiated to determine whether resistin has additional roles in gip-regulated adipocyte functions. analysis of primary adipocytes isolated from retn(-/-), retn(+/-), and retn(+/+) mice found that gip stimulated the pkb/lkb1/ampk/lpl pathway and fatty acid uptake only in retn(+/+) adipocytes, suggesting that gip signaling and/or gip responsiveness were compromised in retn(+/-) and retn(-/-) adipocytes. gip receptor (gipr) protein and mrna were decreased in retn(+/-) and retn(-/-) adipocytes, but resistin treatment rescued lpl responsiveness to gip. in addition, genes encoding tumor necrosis factor (tnf), tnf receptor 2 (tnfr2), and the signaling proteins stress-activated protein kinase (sapk)/jun nh(2)-terminal kinase (jnk), were downregulated, and phosphorylated levels of sapk/jnk/c-jun were decreased in retn(-/-) mice. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to identify a 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa)-response element (tre-iii) responsible for c-jun-mediated transcriptional activation of gipr. blunted gip responsiveness in retn(+/-) and retn(-/-) adipocytes was therefore largely due to the greatly reduced gipr expression associated with decreased c-jun-mediated transcriptional activation of gipr.	@norel@
the transcription factor pitx3 is expressed selectively in midbrain dopaminergic neurons susceptible to neurodegenerative stress. the homeodomain transcription factor pitx3 is critical for the survival of midbrain dopaminergic (mda) neurons. pitx3-deficient mice exhibit severe but selective developmental loss of mda neurons, with accompanying locomotor deficits resembling those seen in parkinson's disease (pd) models. here, we identify specific mda cell subpopulations that are consistently spared in adult pitx3-hypomorphic (aphakia) mice, demonstrating that pitx3 is not indiscriminately required by all mda neurons for their survival. in aphakia mice, virtually all surviving mda neurons in the substantia nigra (sn) and the majority of neurons in the adjacent ventral tegmental area (vta) also express calbindin-d28k, a calcium-binding protein previously associated with resistance to injury in pd and in animal models. cell-mapping studies in wild-type mice revealed that pitx3 is primarily expressed in the ventral sn, a region particularly susceptible to mptp and other dopaminergic neurotoxins. furthermore, pitx3-expressing sn cells are preferentially lost following mptp treatment. finally, sn mda neurons in pitx3 hemizygous mice show increased sensitivity when exposed to mptp. thus, sn mda neurons are represented by at least two distinct subpopulations including mptp-resistant pitx3-autonomous, calbindin-positive neurons, and calbindin-negative pitx-3-dependent cells that display elevated vulnerability to toxic injury, and probably correspond to the subpopulation that degenerates in pd. impairment of pitx3-dependent pathways therefore increases vulnerability of mda neurons to toxic injury. together, these data suggest a novel link between pitx3 function and the selective pattern of mda cell loss observed in pd.	@norel@
transfection of hepg2 cells with hgsta4 provides protection against 4-hydroxynonenal-mediated oxidative injury. 4-hydroxynonenal (4-hne) is a mutagenic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde produced during oxidative injury that is conjugated by several glutathione s-transferase (gst) isoforms. the alpha class human gsta4-4 enzyme (hgsta4-4) has a particularly high catalytic efficiency toward 4-hne conjugation. however, hgst4-4 expression is low in most human cells and there are other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes that detoxify 4-hne. in the current study, we determined the effect of over-expression of hgsta4 mrna on the sensitivity of hepg2 cells to 4-hne injury. hepg2 cells transfected with an hgsta4 vector construct exhibited high steady-state hgsta4 mrna, high gst-4-hne catalytic activities, but lower basal glutathione (gsh) concentrations relative to insert-free vector (control) cells. exposure to 4-hne elicited an increase in gsh concentrations in the control and hgsta4 cells, although the dose-response of gsh induction differed among the two cell types. specifically, hgsta4 cells had significantly higher gsh concentrations when exposed to 5-15 microm 4-hne, but not at 20 microm 4-hne, suggesting extensive gsh utilization at high concentrations of 4-hne. the hgsta4 cells exhibited a significant growth advantage relative to control cells in the absence of 4-hne, and a trend towards increased growth at low dose exposures to 4-hne. however, the hgsta4 cells did not exhibit a growth advantage relative to control cells at higher 4-hne exposures associated with increased gsh utilization. as expected, the hgsta4 cells showed resistance to 4-hne stimulated lipid peroxidation at all 4-hne doses. in summary, our data indicates that over-expression of hgsta4 at levels conferring high gst-4-hne conjugating activity confers a partial growth advantage to hepg2 cells and protects against 4-hne oxidative injury. however, the loss of proliferative capacity of hgsta4 cells challenged with levels of 4-hne associated with severe oxidative stress indicates a role of other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes, and/or gsh-electrophile transporter proteins, in providing full cellular protection against 4-hne toxicity.	4-hne @chemical@ gst @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ glutathione s-transferase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ gst @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ hgsta4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hydroxynonenal @chemical@ glutathione s-transferase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hydroxynonenal @chemical@ gst @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ human gsta4-4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ hgsta4-4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde @chemical@ glutathione s-transferase @gene@ @cpr:9@ alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde @chemical@ gst @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ gst-4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ hgsta4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-hne @chemical@ hgsta4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
long acting beta-agonists versus theophylline for maintenance treatment of asthma. background: theophylline and long acting beta2-agonists are bronchodilators used for the management of persistent asthma symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma. they represent different classes of drug with differing side-effect profiles. objectives: to assess the comparative efficacy, safety and side-effects of long-acting beta-agonists and theophylline in the maintenance treatment of asthma. search strategy: randomised, controlled trials (rcts) were identified using the cochrane airways group register. the register was searched using the following terms: asthma and theophylline and long acting beta-agonist or formoterol or foradile or eformoterol or salmeterol or bambuterol or bitolterol. titles and abstracts were then screened to identify potentially relevant studies. the bibliography of each rct was searched for additional rcts. authors of identified rcts were contacted for other relevant published and unpublished studies. selection criteria: all included studies were rcts involving adults and children with clinical evidence of asthma. these studies must have compared oral sustained release and/or dose adjusted theophylline with an inhaled long-acting beta-agonist. data collection and analysis: potentially relevant trials, identified by screening titles and/or abstracts, were obtained. two reviewers independently assessed full text versions of these trials to decided whether the trial should be included in the review, and assessed its methodological quality. where there was disagreement between reviewers, this was resolved by consensus, or reference to a third party. data were extracted by two independent reviewers. inter-rater reliability was assessed by simple agreement. study authors were contacted to clarify randomisation methods, provide missing data, verify the data extracted and identify unpublished studies. relevant pharmaceutical manufacturers were also contacted. main results: six trials met the inclusion criteria. five used salmeterol and one, biltoterol. they were of varying quality. there was a trend for salmeterol to improve fev1 more than theophylline in three studies and salmeterol use was associated with more symptom free nights. bitolterol, used in only one study, was reported to be less effective than theophylline. subjects taking salmeterol experienced fewer adverse events than those using theophylline (relative risk 0.38; 95%confidence intervals 0.25, 0.57). significant reductions were reported for central nervous system adverse events (relative risk 0.51; 95%confidence intervals 0.30, 0.88) and gastrointestinal adverse events (relative risk 0.32; 95%confidence intervals 0.17, 0.59). reviewer's conclusions: salmeterol may be more effective than theophylline in reducing asthma symptoms including night waking and improving lung function. more adverse events occurred in subjects using theophylline when compared to salmeterol.	@norel@

solubility-driven optimization of (pyridin-3-yl) benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones leading to a promising antibacterial agent. the solubility-driven structural modification of (pyridin-3-yl) benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones is described, which resulted in the development of a new series of benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinone analogues with high antibacterial activity against gram-positive pathogens, including that against linezolid-resistant strains and low herg inhibition. with regard to structure-activity relationship (sar) trends among the various substituents on the pyridyl ring, relatively small and nonbasic substituents were preferable to sterically demanding or basic substituents. oxazolidinone ring substitution on the pyridyl ring generated analogues with antibacterial activity superior to imidazolidinone ring. solubility was enhanced by the incorporation of polar groups, especially when compounds were converted to their prodrugs. among the prodrugs, compound 85 exhibited excellent solubility and a good pharmacokinetic profile. in a mrsa systemic infection model, compound 85 displayed an ed50 = 5.00 mg/kg, a potency that is 2-fold better than that of linezolid.	benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinone @chemical@ herg @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the neuropharmacological basis for the use of memantine in the treatment of alzheimer's disease. memantine has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the symptomatic treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad). while the neurobiological basis for the therapeutic activity of memantine is not fully understood, the drug is not a cholinesterase inhibitor and, therefore, acts differently from current ad therapies. memantine can interact with a variety of ligand-gated ion channels. however, nmda receptors appear to be a key target of memantine at therapeutic concentrations. memantine is an uncompetitive (channel blocking) nmda receptor antagonist. like other nmda receptor antagonists, memantine at high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory. however, at lower, clinically relevant concentrations memantine can under some circumstances promote synaptic plasticity and preserve or enhance memory in animal models of ad. in addition, memantine can protect against the excitotoxic destruction of cholinergic neurons. blockade of nmda receptors by memantine could theoretically confer disease-modifying activity in ad by inhibiting the "weak" nmda receptor-dependent excitotoxicity that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive neuronal loss that underlies the evolving dementia. moreover, recent in vitro studies suggest that memantine abrogates beta-amyloid (abeta) toxicity and possibly inhibits abeta production. considerable attention has focused on the investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of memantine over other nmda receptor antagonists, particularly those that act by a similar channel blocking mechanism such as dissociative anesthetic-like agents (phencyclidine, ketamine, mk-801). a variety of channel-level factors could be relevant, including fast channel-blocking kinetics and strong voltage-dependence (allowing rapid relief of block during synaptic activity), as well as reduced trapping (permitting egress from closed channels). these factors may allow memantine to block channel activity induced by low, tonic levels of glutamate--an action that might contribute to symptomatic improvement and could theoretically protect against weak excitotoxicity--while sparing synaptic responses required for normal behavioral functioning, cognition and memory.	memantine @chemical@ beta-amyloid @gene@ @cpr:4@ memantine @chemical@ abeta @gene@ @cpr:4@ memantine @chemical@ abeta @gene@ @cpr:4@ memantine @chemical@ nmda receptors @gene@ @cpr:4@ memantine @chemical@ nmda receptor @gene@ @cpr:4@ memantine @chemical@ nmda receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ memantine @chemical@ nmda receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ memantine @chemical@ nmda receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
the inhibitory effect of sodium nitroprusside on hif-1 activation is not dependent on nitric oxide-soluble guanylyl cyclase pathway. adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of o(2) homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. one of the most important transcription factors that activate the expression of o(2)-regulated genes is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (hif-1). nitric oxide (no) mediates a variety of biological effects including relaxation of blood vessels and cytotoxicity of activated macrophages. we investigated the effect of the clinically used nitrates nitroglycerin (ntg), isosorbide dinitrate (isdn), and sodium nitroprusside (snp) on hif-1-mediated transcriptional responses to hypoxia. we demonstrate that among the three nitrates, only snp inhibits hif-1 activation in response to hypoxia. in contrast, ntg or isdn does not affect hif-1 activity. snp inhibits the accumulation of hif-1alpha, the regulatory subunit of hif-1, and the transcriptional activation of hif-1alpha via a mechanism that is not dependent on either no or soluble guanylate cyclase.	snp @chemical@ hif-1alpha @gene@ @cpr:4@ snp @chemical@ hif-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ snp @chemical@ hif-1alpha @gene@ @cpr:4@ snp @chemical@ hif-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sodium nitroprusside @chemical@ hif-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
characterization of four new mouse cytochrome p450 enzymes of the cyp2j subfamily. the cytochrome p450 superfamily encompasses a diverse group of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of various substrates. the mouse cyp2j subfamily includes members that have wide tissue distribution and are active in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (aa), linoleic acid (la), and other lipids and xenobiotics. the mouse cyp2j locus contains seven genes and three pseudogenes located in a contiguous 0.62 megabase cluster on chromosome 4. we describe four new mouse cyp2j isoforms (designated cyp2j8, cyp2j11, cyp2j12, and cyp2j13). the four cdnas contain open reading frames that encode polypeptides with 62-84% identity with the three previously identified mouse cyp2js. all four new cyp2j proteins were expressed in sf21 insect cells. each recombinant protein metabolized aa and la to epoxides and hydroxy derivatives. specific antibodies, mrna probes, and polymerase chain reaction primer sets were developed for each mouse cyp2j to examine their tissue distribution. cyp2j8 transcripts were found in the kidney, liver, and brain, and protein expression was confirmed in the kidney and brain (neuropil). cyp2j11 transcripts were most abundant in the kidney and heart, with protein detected primarily in the kidney (proximal convoluted tubules), liver, and heart (cardiomyocytes). cyp2j12 transcripts were prominently present in the brain, and cyp2j13 transcripts were detected in multiple tissues, with the highest expression in the kidney. cyp2j12 and cyp2j13 protein expression could not be determined because the antibodies developed were not immunospecific. we conclude that the four new cyp2j isoforms might be involved in the metabolism of aa and la to bioactive lipids in mouse hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.	arachidonic acid @chemical@ cyp2j @gene@ @cpr:9@ linoleic acid @chemical@ cyp2j @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
mechanism of action of leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis. leflunomide, a novel drug with proven efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis, is an isoxazol derivative structurally unrelated to other immunomodulatory drugs. leflunomide is rapidly metabolized to its active form, a77 1726. two mechanisms of action have been identified for a77 1726: inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (dhodh) and inhibition of tyrosine kinases. dhodh inhibition occurs at lower concentrations of a77 1726 than that of tyrosine kinases and is currently considered the major mode of action. stimulated lymphocytes must increase ribonucleotide levels from 8 to 16-fold before proceeding from the g1 into the s phase. increased levels of ribonucleotides can only be met by de novo ribonucleotide synthesis. at low levels of ribonucleotides, p53, a "sensor" molecule, gets activated and prevents progression through the cell cycle. therefore, an inhibitor of de novo uridine monophosphate synthesis would predictably arrest stimulated cells at the g1 phase. in support of this mechanism of action, in vitro mitogen stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with a77 1726 undergo arrest at the g1 phase; this inhibition is reversed by uridine.	a77 1726 @chemical@ dihydroorotate dehydrogenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ a77 1726 @chemical@ dhodh @gene@ @cpr:4@ a77 1726 @chemical@ tyrosine kinases @gene@ @cpr:4@ a77 1726 @chemical@ dhodh @gene@ @cpr:4@ a77 1726 @chemical@ tyrosine kinases @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
differential interactions of heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans with the selectins. implications for the use of unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins as therapeutic agents. the selectins are calcium-dependent c-type lectins that bind certain sialylated, fucosylated, sulfated glycoprotein ligands. l-selectin also recognizes endothelial proteoglycans in a calcium-dependent manner, via heparan sulfate (hs) glycosaminoglycan chains enriched in unsubstituted glucosamine units. we now show that these hs chains can also bind p-selectin, but not e-selectin. however, while l-selectin binding requires micromolar levels of free calcium, p-selectin recognition is largely divalent cation-independent. despite this, hs chains bound to p-selectin are eluted by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta), but only at high concentrations. porcine intestinal mucosal (mast cell-derived) heparin (pim-heparin) shows similar properties, with no binding to e-selectin, calcium-dependent binding of a subfraction to l-selectin and to p-selectin, and calcium-independent binding of a larger fraction to p-selectin, the latter being disrupted by high edta concentrations. analysis of defined heparin fragment pools shows a size dependence for interaction, with tetradecasaccharides showing easily detectable binding to l- and p-selectin affinity columns. l-selectin binding fragments include more heavily sulfated and epimerized regions and, as with the endothelial hs chains, they are enriched in free amino groups. the p-selectin binding component includes this fraction as well as some less highly modified regions. thus, endothelium-derived hs chains and mast cell-derived heparins could play a role in modulating the biology of selectins in vivo. notably, p- and l-selectin binding to sialyl-lewisx and to hl-60 cells (which are known to carry the native ligand psgl-1) is inhibited by unfractionated pharmaceutical heparin preparations at concentrations 12-50-fold lower than those recommended for effective anticoagulation in vivo. in contrast, two low molecular weight heparins currently considered as clinical replacements for unfractionated heparin are much poorer inhibitors. thus, patients undergoing heparin therapy for other reasons may be experiencing clinically significant inhibition of l- and p-selectin function, and the current switchover to low-molecular weight heparins may come at some loss of this effect. low-dose unfractionated heparin should be investigated as a treatment option for acute and chronic diseases in which p- and l-selectin play pathological roles.	@norel@
functional and molecular characterization of multiple k-cl cotransporter isoforms in corneal epithelial cells. the dependence of regulatory volume decrease (rvd) activity on potassium-chloride cotransporter (kcc) isoform expression was characterized in corneal epithelial cells (cec). during exposure to a 50% hypotonic challenge, the rvd response was larger in sv40-immortalized human cec (hcec) than in sv40-immortalized rabbit cec (rcec). a kcc inhibitor-[(dihydroindenyl)oxy] alkanoic acid (dioa)-blocked rvd more in hcec than rcec. under isotonic conditions, n-ethylmaleimide (nem) produced kcc activation and transient cell shrinkage. both of these changes were greater in hcec than in rcec. immunoblot analysis of hcec, rcec, primary human cec (phcec), and primary bovine cec (bcec) plasma membrane enriched fractions revealed kcc1, kcc3, and kcc4 isoform expression, whereas kcc2 was undetectable. during a hypotonic challenge, kcc1 membrane content increased more rapidly in hcec than in rcec. such a challenge induced a larger increase and more transient p44/42mapk activation in hcec than rcec. on the other hand, hcec and rcec p38mapk phosphorylation reached peak activations at 2.5 and 15 min, respectively. only in hcec, pharmacological manipulation of kcc activity modified the hypotonicity-induced activation of p44/42mapk, whereas p38mapk phosphorylation was insensitive to such procedures in both cell lines. larger increases in hcec kcc1 membrane protein content correlated with their ability to undergo faster and more complete rvd. furthermore, pharmacological activation of kcc increased p44/42mapk phosphorylation in hcec but not in rcec, presumably a reflection of low kcc1 membrane expression in rcec. these findings suggest that kcc1 plays a role in (i) maintaining isotonic steady-state cell volume homeostasis, (ii) recovery of isotonic cell volume after a hypotonic challenge through rvd, and (iii) regulating hypotonicity-induced activation of the p44/42mapk signaling pathway required for cell proliferation.	n-ethylmaleimide @chemical@ kcc @gene@ @cpr:3@ nem @chemical@ kcc @gene@ @cpr:3@ [(dihydroindenyl)oxy] alkanoic acid @chemical@ kcc @gene@ @cpr:4@ dioa @chemical@ kcc @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
differential cell-protective function of two resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) glucosides against oxidative stress. resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene; rsv), a natural polyphenol, exerts a beneficial effect on health and diseases. rsv targets and activates the nad(+)-dependent protein deacetylase sirt1; in turn, sirt1 induces an intracellular antioxidative mechanism by inducing mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (sod2). most rsv found in plants is glycosylated, and the effect of these glycosylated forms on sirt1 has not been studied. in this study, we compared the effects of rsv and two glycosyl rsvs, resveratrol-3-o-β-d-glucoside (3g-rsv; polydatin/piceid) and resveratrol-4'-o-β-d-glucoside (4'g-rsv), at the cellular level. in oxygen radical absorbance capacity and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assays, the antioxidant activity of 3g-rsv was comparable to that of rsv, whereas the radical-scavenging efficiency of 4'g-rsv was less than 50% of that of rsv. however, 4'g-rsv, but not 3g-rsv, induced sirt1-dependent histone h3 deacetylation and sod2 expression in mouse c2c12 skeletal myoblasts; as with rsv, sirt1 knockdown blunted these effects. rsv and 4'g-rsv, but not 3g-rsv, mitigated oxidative stress-induced cell death in c2c12 cells and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. rsv and 4'g-rsv inhibited c2c12 cell proliferation, but 3g-rsv did not. rsv was found in both the intracellular and extracellular fractions of c2c12 cells that had been incubated with 4'g-rsv, indicating that 4'g-rsv was extracellularly deglycosylated to rsv, which was then taken up by the cells. c2c12 cells did not deglycosylate 3g-rsv. our results point to 4'g-rsv as a useful rsv prodrug with high water solubility. these data also show that the in vitro antioxidative activity of these molecules did not correlate with their ability to protect cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.	4'g-rsv @chemical@ sirt1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ rsv @chemical@ nad(+)-dependent protein deacetylase sirt1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ rsv @chemical@ sirt1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 4'g-rsv @chemical@ sod2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ rsv @chemical@ mitochondrial superoxide dismutase @gene@ @cpr:3@ rsv @chemical@ sod2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
gene expression signature of parathion-transformed human breast epithelial cells. environmental substances seem to be involved in the etiology of breast cancers. many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the organophosphorous pesticides. parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. the primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of parathion and atropine on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. these studies showed that parathion alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, mcf-10f as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. there was also an increase in c-kit, trio, rho-a, rac-3, egfr, notch-4, dvl-2, ezrin, beta catenin and mutant p53 protein expression in the parathion-treated cells. however, atropine significantly inhibited this increase. in a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by parathion treatment. among the genes affected were the cyclins, such as cyclin d3, the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) such as cdk41 and the minichromosome maintenance deficient (mcm) mcm2 and mcm3. it is suggested that parathion influences human breast epithelial cell transformation and is an initiator factor in the transformation process in breast cancer.	parathion @chemical@ c-kit @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ trio @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ rho-a @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ rac-3 @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ notch-4 @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ dvl-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ ezrin @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ beta catenin @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ p53 @gene@ @cpr:3@ parathion @chemical@ cholinesterase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
renal failure associated with the use of celecoxib and rofecoxib. objective: celecoxib and rofecoxib are two relatively new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) that selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) isoenzyme at therapeutic concentrations. the nephrotoxic potential of selective cox-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. this study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. methods: a search was performed in the us food and drug administration's (fda) adverse event reporting system (aers) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the fda. a medline search of the english language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib. results: one hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic us cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the aers database. the literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. in addition, drug regulatory authorities in the uk, canada, and australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib. descriptive statistics of the aers cases have been summarised in this report. conclusions: data from aers and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective nsaids. physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ace inhibitors, and the elderly. kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. in addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur. celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended for use in patients with advanced renal disease.	rofecoxib @chemical@ cyclo-oxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ rofecoxib @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ celecoxib @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ rofecoxib @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ celecoxib @chemical@ cyclo-oxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ celecoxib @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
a novel benzo[d]imidazole derivate prevents the development of dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine experimental colitis via inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasome. nlrp3 inflammasome has been reported to be associated with various kinds of immunological diseases including colitis. however, there are few drug candidates targeting inflammasomes for the treatment of colitis. in the present study, we aimed at examining the effect of 1-ethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1h-benzo[d]imidazole, a synthetic small molecular compound also named fc11a-2, for the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced experimental colitis in mice via targeting nlrp3 inflammasome. treatment with fc11a-2 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of body weight and shortening of colon length induced by dss. in addition, the disease activity index, histopathologic scores and myeloperoxidase activity were also significantly reduced by fc11a-2 treatment. moreover, protein and mrna levels of dss-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including tnf-α, il-1β, il-18, il-17a and ifn-γ, were markedly suppressed by fc11a-2. furthermore, a decreased cd11c(+) macrophage infiltration in colons and inactivation of caspase-1 in peritoneal macrophages were detected in fc11a-2-treated mice. the mechanism of action of fc11a-2 was related to the inhibition of the cleavage of pro-caspase-1, pro-il-1β and pro-il-18 which in turn suppressed the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome. taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of fc11a-2 to inhibit nlrp3 inflammasome activation and its potential use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.	fc11a-2 @chemical@ pro-caspase-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ pro-il-1β @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ pro-il-18 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ cytokines @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ tnf-α @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ il-1β @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ il-18 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ il-17a @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ ifn-γ @gene@ @cpr:4@ benzo[d]imidazole @chemical@ nlrp3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a @chemical@ caspase-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ nlrp3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ nlrp3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fc11a-2 @chemical@ myeloperoxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
therapeutic effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin a: potent blockade of autonomic transmission by targeted cleavage of only the pertinent snap-25. in search of a basis for the impressive potency of an endoprotease that cleaves snap-25, botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a), in treating numerous diseases due to hyper-active autonomic nerves, truncation of its target and inhibition of neurotransmission were studied in rat sympathetic neurons. tetrodotoxin-sensitive spontaneous cholinergic neurotransmission was blocked >80% by 1 pm bont/a despite cleaving <20% of the snap-25. a maximum cleavage of ∼60% snap-25 could be achieved with >1 nm bont/a, despite an absence of non-cleavable snap-25 in the detergent-solubilised neurons. in contrast, bont/e (100 nm) truncated nearly all the snap-25 in the intact cells, but was unable to block neurotransmission at low concentrations like bont/a. chimeras created by inserting the acceptor-binding hc domain of bont/a into bont/e still cleaved all the snap-25, indicating ubiquitous expression of bont/a acceptors. accordingly, sv2 and snap-25 were found to be co-expressed and broadly co-localised in neurons, but absent from non-neuronal cells. on the other hand, partial cleavage by the bont/a protease persisted upon replacing its hc with counterparts from bont/e or bont/b. moreover, limited cleavage of snap-25 was conferred onto the protease from bont/e when fused to the n-terminus of bont/a. thus, the bont/a protease is uniquely well-adapted for selectively inactivating the snap-25 directly involved in neurotransmission; this together with the toxin's acceptor and its target being localised on the peri-somatic boutons likely contribute to its exceptional therapeutic utility in the clinic.	@norel@
liver x receptors, nervous system and lipid metabolism. lipids in the nervous system are represented by cholesterol and phospholipids as constituents of cell membranes and, in particular, of myelin. therefore, lipids are finely regulated to guarantee physiological functions. in the central nervous system, cholesterol is locally synthesized due to the presence of the blood brain barrier. in the peripheral nervous system cholesterol is either uptaken by lipoproteins and/or produced by de novo biosynthesis. defects in lipid homeostasis in these tissues lead to structural and functional changes that often result in different pathological conditions depending on the affected pathways (i.e. cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol efflux, fatty acid biosynthesis etc.). alterations in cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system are linked to several disorders such as alzheimer's disease, huntington disease, parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, smith-lemli-opitz syndrome, niemann-pick type c disease, and glioblastoma. in the peripheral nervous system changes in lipid metabolism are associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy that may be caused by metabolic disorders, injuries, therapeutics and autoimmune diseases. transcription factors, such as the liver x receptors (lxrs), regulate both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism in several tissues including the nervous system. in the last few years several studies elucidated the biology of lxrs in nervous system due to the availability of knock-out mice and the development of synthetic ligands. here, we review a survey of the literature focused on central and peripheral nervous system and in physiological and pathological settings with particular attention on the roles played by lxrs in both districts.	@norel@
rescue of platinum-damaged oocytes from programmed cell death through inactivation of the p53 family signaling network. non-proliferating oocytes within avascular regions of the ovary are exquisitely susceptible to chemotherapy. early menopause and sterility are unintended consequences of chemotherapy, and efforts to understand the oocyte apoptotic pathway may provide new targets for mitigating this outcome. recently, the c-abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) has become the focus of research as a fertoprotective drug against cisplatin. however, the mechanism by which imatinib protects oocytes is not fully understood, and reports of the drug's efficacy have been contradictory. using in vitro culture and subrenal grafting of mouse ovaries, we demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of oocytes within primordial follicles. we found that, before apoptosis, cisplatin induces c-abl and tap73 expression in the oocyte. oocytes undergoing apoptosis showed downregulation of tap63 and upregulation of bax. while imatinib was unable to block cisplatin-induced dna damage and damage response, such as the upregulation of p53, imatinib inhibited the cisplatin-induced nuclear accumulation of c-abl/tap73 and the subsequent downregulation of tap63 and upregulation of bax, thereby abrogating oocyte cell death. surprisingly, the conditional deletion of trp63, but not δnp63, in oocytes inhibited apoptosis, as well as the accumulation of c-abl and tap73 caused by cisplatin. these data suggest that tap63 is the master regulator of cisplatin-induced oocyte death. the expression kinetics of tap63, c-abl and tap73 suggest that cisplatin activates tap63-dependent expression of c-abl and tap73 and, in turn, the activation of tap73 by c-abl-induced bax expression. our findings indicate that imatinib protects oocytes from cisplatin-induced cell death by inhibiting c-abl kinase, which would otherwise activate tap73-bax-mediated apoptosis. thus, imatinib and other c-abl kinase inhibitors provide an intriguing new way to halt cisplatin-induced oocyte death in early follicles and perhaps conserve the endocrine function of the ovary against chemotherapy.cell death and differentiation advance online publication, 19 april 2013; doi:10.1038/cdd.2013.31.	cisplatin @chemical@ tap63 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:3@ imatinib @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ p53 @gene@ @cpr:3@ imatinib @chemical@ tap63 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cisplatin @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:3@ imatinib @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:4@ cisplatin @chemical@ tap63 @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib mesylate @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib mesylate @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ tap73 @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ c-abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
kinetic mechanism of quinone oxidoreductase 2 and its inhibition by the antimalarial quinolines. quinone oxidoreductase 2 (qr2) purified from human red blood cells was recently shown to be a potential target of the quinoline antimalarial compounds [graves et al., (2002) mol. pharmacol. 62, 1364]. qr2 catalyzes the two-electron reduction of menadione via the oxidation of n-alkylated or n-ribosylated nicotinamides. to investigate the mechanism and consequences of inhibition of qr2 by the quinolines further, we have used steady-state and transient-state kinetics to define the mechanism of qr2. importantly, we have shown that qr2 when isolated from an overproducing strain of e. coli is kinetically equivalent to the enzyme from the native human red blood cell source. we observe ping-pong kinetics consistent with one substrate/inhibitor binding site that shows selectivity for the oxidation state of the fad cofactor, suggesting that selective inhibition of the liver versus red blood cell forms of malaria may be possible. the reductant n-methyldihydronicotinamide and the inhibitor primaquine bind exclusively to the oxidized enzyme. in contrast, the inhibitors quinacrine and chloroquine bind exclusively to the reduced enzyme. the quinone substrate menadione, on the other hand, binds nonspecifically to both forms of the enzyme. single-turnover kinetics of the reductive half-reaction are chemically and kinetically competent and confirm the inhibitor selectivity seen in the steady-state experiments. our studies shed light on the possible in vivo potency of the quinolines and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at creating more potent qr2 inhibitors and at understanding the physiological significance of qr2.	quinolines @chemical@ qr2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinolines @chemical@ qr2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinolines @chemical@ quinone oxidoreductase 2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinolines @chemical@ qr2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ n-ribosylated nicotinamides @chemical@ qr2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ menadione @chemical@ qr2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ n-alkylated @chemical@ qr2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) receptor-alpha-activated c-jun nh2-terminal kinase-1 is critical for pdgf-induced p21waf1/cip1 promoter activity independent of p53. platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) is a potent mitogen for mesenchymal cells. pdgf aa functions as a "competent factor" that stimulates cell cycle entry but requires additional (progression) factors in serum to transit the cell cycle beyond the g1/s checkpoint. unlike pdgf aa, pdgf b-chain (c-sis) homodimer (pdgf bb) and its viral counterpart v-sis can serve as both competent and progression factors. pdgf bb activates alpha- and beta-receptor subunits (alpha-pdgfr and beta-pdgfr) and induces phenotypic transformation in nih 3t3 cells, whereas pdgf aa activates alpha-pdgfr only and fails to induce transformation. we showed previously that alpha-pdgfr antagonizes beta-pdgfr-mediated transformation through activation of stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-jun nh2-terminal kinase-1, whereas both alpha-pdgfr and beta-pdgfr induce mitogenic signals. these studies revealed a striking feature of pdgf signaling; the specificity and the strength of the pdgf growth signal is modulated by alpha-pdgfr-mediated simultaneous activation of growth stimulatory and inhibitory signals, whereas beta-pdgfr mainly induces a growth-promoting signal. here we demonstrate that pdgf bb activation of beta-pdgfr alone results in more efficient cell cycle transition from g1 to s phase than pdgf bb activation of both alpha-pdgfr and beta-pdgfr. pdgf aa activation of alpha-pdgfr or pdgf bb activation of both alpha- and beta-pdgfrs up-regulates expression of p21waf1/cip1, an inhibitor of cell cycle-dependent kinases and a downstream mediator of the tumor suppressor gene product p53. however, beta-pdgfr activation alone fails to induce p21waf1/cip1 expression. we also demonstrate that alpha-pdgfr-activated jnk-1 is a critical signaling component for pdgf induction of p21waf1/cip1 promoter activity. the ability of pdgf/jnk-1 to induce p21waf1/cip1 promoter activity is independent of p53, although the overall p21waf1/cip1 promoter activities are greatly reduced in the absence of p53. these results provide a molecular basis for differential regulation of the cell cycle and transformation by alpha- and beta-pdgfrs.	@norel@
influence of surface groups on poly(propylene imine) dendrimers antiprion activity. prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of prp(sc), an aberrantly folded isoform of the host protein prp(c). specific forms of synthetic molecules known as dendrimers are able to eliminate protease-resistant prp(sc) in both an intracellular and in vitro setting. the properties of a dendrimer which govern this ability are unknown. we addressed the issue by comparing the in vitro antiprion ability of numerous modified poly(propylene-imine) dendrimers, which varied in size, structure, charge, and surface group composition. several of the modified dendrimers, including an anionic glycodendrimer, reduced the level of protease resistant prp(sc) in a prion strain-dependent manner. this led to the formulation of a new working model for dendrimer/prion interactions which proposes dendrimers eliminate prp(sc) by destabilizing the protein and rendering it susceptible to proteolysis. this ability is not dependent on any particular charge of dendrimer, but does require a high density of reactive surface groups.	@norel@
cadmium induces mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cell by an eralpha-dependent mechanism. breast cancer (bc) is linked to estrogen exposure. estradiol (e2) stimulates bc cells proliferation by binding the estrogen receptor (er). hormone-related cancers have been linked to estrogenic environmental contaminants. cadmium (cd) a toxic pollutant, acts as estrogens in bc cells. purpose of our study was to evaluate whether cd regulates mcf-7 cell proliferation by activating erk1/2, akt and pdgfralpha kinases. cd increased cell proliferation and the er-antagonist ici 182,780 blunted it. to characterize an er-dependent mechanism, eralpha/beta expression was evaluated. cd decreased eralpha expression, but not erbeta. cd also increased erk1/2, akt and pdgfralpha phosphorylation while ici blocked it. since stimulation of phosphorylation was slower than expected, c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes, and pdgfa were analyzed. cd rapidly increased c-jun, c-fos and pdgfa expression. cells were also co-incubated with the cd and specific kinases inhibitors, which blocked the cd-stimulated proliferation. in conclusion, our results indicate that cd increases bc cell proliferation in vitro by stimulating akt, erk1/2 and pdgfralpha kinases activity likely by activating c-fos, c-jun and pdgfa by an eralpha-dependent mechanism.	cd @chemical@ akt @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ pdgfralpha @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ kinases @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ c-fos @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ c-jun @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ pdgfa @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ akt @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ pdgfralpha @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ c-jun @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ c-fos @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ pdgfa @gene@ @cpr:3@ cd @chemical@ eralpha @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
superparamagnetic hollow hybrid nanogels as a potential guidable vehicle system of stimuli-mediated mr imaging and multiple cancer therapeutics. hollow hybrid nanogels were prepared first by co-assembly of the citric acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (spions) (44 wt%) with the graft copolymer (56 wt%) comprising acrylic acid and 2-methacryloylethyl acrylate units as the backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) as the grafts in aqueous phase of ph 3.0 into the hybrid vesicle structure, followed by in situ covalent stabilization via the photo-initiated polymerization of mea residues within vesicles. the resultant hollow nanogels, though slightly swollen, satisfactorily retain the structural integrity while the medium ph being adjusted to 7.4. confining spion clusters to such a high level (44 wt%) within the ph-responsive thin gel layer remarkably enhances the transverse relaxivity (r2) and renders the mr imaging highly ph-tunable. for example, with the ph being adjusted from 4.0 to 7.4, the r2 value can be dramatically increased from 138.5 to 265.5 mm-1 s-1. the dox-loaded hybrid nanogels also exhibit accelerated drug release in response to both ph reduction and temperature increase due to the substantial disruption of the interactions between drug molecules and copolymer components. with magnetic transport guidance toward the target and subsequent exposure to alternating magnetic field, this dox-loaded nanogel system possessing combined capabilities of hyperthermia and stimuli-triggered drug release showed superior in vitro cytotoxicity against hela cells as compared to the case with only free drug or hyperthermia alone. this work demonstrates that the hollow inorganic/organic hybrid nanogels show great potential to serve as a multimodal theranostic vehicle functionalized with such desirable features as guidable delivery of stimuli-mediated diagnostic imaging and hyperthermia/chemotherapies.	@norel@
ruxolitinib: a new treatment option for myelofibrosis. myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. evolution of myelofibrosis can lead to life-threatening complications, including transformation to leukemia, thrombotic events, and hemorrhagic episodes. the only curative therapy for myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. because this disease manifests primarily in the older population, many patients diagnosed with myelofibrosis are not considered medically fit for such aggressive therapy. other available medical therapies do not halt disease progression; instead, current treatment strategies have focused on targeting specific symptomology, although with limited efficacy. the lack of effective treatment options for patients with myelofibrosis has rendered this orphan disease state an unmet medical need, and novel approaches to improve outcomes are necessary. emerging research has identified numerous molecular mutations in patients with myelofibrosis, making this disease a potential candidate for molecularly targeted therapy. the most prevalent mutation identified is a gain-of-function mutation in the janus kinase (jak) family, jak2 v617f, which has been identified in more than half of patients with myelofibrosis. this mutation results in a constitutively active jak-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway resulting in dysregulated cellular proliferation and hematopoiesis. ruxolitinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of jak1 and jak2 and recently became the first drug approved by the united states food and drug administration for the treatment of symptomatic intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis. in clinical trials, ruxolitinib demonstrated promising efficacy in reducing splenomegaly and myelofibrosis-related symptoms. however, ruxolitinib did not demonstrate disease-modifying potential and is not considered a curative therapeutic option. adverse events associated with ruxolitinib are primarily hematologic, with thrombocytopenia and anemia being the most common toxicologic events identified. future research will shed light on whether ruxolitinib in combination with other treatments will further enhance outcomes in myelofibrosis.	ruxolitinib @chemical@ jak1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ruxolitinib @chemical@ jak2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel hybrid compounds of imidazole scaffold-based 2-benzylbenzofuran as potent anticancer agents. a series of novel hybrid compounds between 2-benzylbenzofuran and imidazole has been prepared and evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. the results suggest that the existence of benzimidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or 4-methoxyphenacyl group were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. in particular, hybrid compounds 46 and 47 were found to be the most potent derivatives against 5 strains human tumor cell lines and more active than cisplatin (ddp), and exhibited cytotoxic activities selectively against breast carcinoma (mcf-7) and myeloid liver carcinoma (smmc-7721), respectively.	@norel@
glp-1 receptor expression in human tumors and human normal tissues: potential for in vivo targeting. unlabelled: peptide hormone receptors overexpressed in human tumors, such as somatostatin receptors, can be used for in vivo targeting for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. a novel promising candidate in this field is the glp-1 receptor, which was recently shown to be massively overexpressed in gut and lung neuroendocrine tumors--in particular, in insulinomas. anticipating a major development of glp-1 receptor targeting in nuclear medicine, our aim was to evaluate in vitro the glp-1 receptor expression in a large variety of other tumors and to compare it with that in nonneoplastic tissues. methods: the glp-1 receptor protein expression was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated in a broad spectrum of human tumors (n=419) and nonneoplastic human tissues (n=209) with receptor autoradiography using (125)i-glp-1(7-36)amide. pharmacologic competition experiments were performed to provide proof of specificity of the procedure. results: glp-1 receptors were expressed in various endocrine tumors, with particularly high amounts in pheochromocytomas, as well as in brain tumors and embryonic tumors but not in carcinomas or lymphomas. in nonneoplastic tissues, glp-1 receptors were present in generally low amounts in specific tissue compartments of several organs--namely, pancreas, intestine, lung, kidney, breast, and brain; no receptors were identified in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, or the adrenal gland. the rank order of potencies for receptor binding--namely, glp-1(7-36)amide = exendin-4 >> glp-2 = glucagon(1-29)--provided proof of specific glp-1 receptor identification. conclusion: the glp-1 receptors may represent a novel molecular target for in vivo scintigraphy and targeted radiotherapy for a variety of glp-1 receptor-expressing tumors. for glp-1 receptor scintigraphy, a low-background signal can be expected, on the basis of the low receptor expression in the normal tissues surrounding tumors.	@norel@
apoptosis induced neurotoxicity of di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato) tin (iv) via mitochondria-mediated pathway in pc12 cells. the severe toxicity of antitumor organotin (iv) compounds limits their application in clinic, however, the toxic mechanism is still unclear. di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato) tin (iv) (dbdct), an antitumor agent with high activity and obvious neurotoxicity was chosen as a typical diorganotin (iv) compound to investigate its neurotoxic mechanism using pc12 cells and comprehensive methods. treatment with dbdct resulted in a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition of pc12 cells. the changes in cell morphology were observed using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. pc12 cell apoptosis induced by dbdct was confirmed by annexin v/propidium iodide staining, and characterized by cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 proteins. dbdct induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the generation of reactive oxygen species. dbdct up-regulated the expression of bax, down-regulated the expression of bcl-2, and significantly increased the ratio of bax/bcl-2. dbdct also caused the phosphorylation of jnk and p38(mapk). in rats exposed to dbdct, apoptosis was also observed in brain, as shown by the detection of cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 proteins and increased tunel positive staining. in conclusion, the results demonstrated that dbdct caused the neurotoxicity by inducing apoptosis via mitochondria-mediated pathway.	dbdct @chemical@ jnk @gene@ @cpr:3@ dbdct @chemical@ p38 @gene@ @cpr:3@ dbdct @chemical@ mapk @gene@ @cpr:3@ dbdct @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:3@ dbdct @chemical@ bcl-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ dbdct @chemical@ bax @gene@ @cpr:3@ dbdct @chemical@ bcl-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
bioinspired and highly oriented clay nanocomposites with a xyloglucan biopolymer matrix: extending the range of mechanical and barrier properties. the development of clay bionanocomposites requires processing routes with nanostructural control. moreover, moisture durability is a concern with water-soluble biopolymers. here, oriented bionanocomposite coatings with strong in-plane orientation of clay platelets are for the first time prepared by continuous water-based processing. montmorillonite (mtm) and a "new" unmodified biological polymer (xyloglucan (xg)) are combined. the resulting nanocomposites are characterized by fe-sem, tem, and xrd. xg adsorption on mtm is measured by quartz crystal microbalance analysis. mechanical and gas barrier properties are measured, also at high relative humidity. the reinforcement effects are modeled. xg dimensions in composites are estimated using atomistic simulations. the nanostructure shows highly oriented and intercalated clay platelets. the reinforcement efficiency and effects on barrier properties are remarkable and are likely to be due to highly oriented and well-dispersed mtm and strong xg-mtm interactions. properties are well preserved in humid conditions and the reasons for this are discussed.	@norel@
the glutamate-aspartate transporter glast mediates glutamate uptake at inner hair cell afferent synapses in the mammalian cochlea. ribbon synapses formed between inner hair cells (ihcs) and afferent dendrites in the mammalian cochlea can sustain high rates of release, placing strong demands on glutamate clearance mechanisms. to investigate the role of transporters in glutamate removal at these synapses, we made whole-cell recordings from ihcs, afferent dendrites, and glial cells adjacent to ihcs [inner phalangeal cells (ipcs)] in whole-mount preparations of rat organ of corti. focal application of the transporter substrate d-aspartate elicited inward currents in ipcs, which were larger in the presence of anions that permeate the transporter-associated anion channel and blocked by the transporter antagonist d,l-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate. these currents were produced by glutamate-aspartate transporters (glast) (excitatory amino acid transporter 1) because they were weakly inhibited by dihydrokainate, an antagonist of glutamate transporter-1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2) and were absent from ipcs in glast-/- cochleas. furthermore, d-aspartate-induced currents in outside-out patches from ipcs exhibited larger steady-state currents than responses elicited by l-glutamate, a prominent feature of glast, and examination of cochlea from glast-discosoma red (dsred) promoter reporter mice revealed that dsred expression was restricted to ipcs and other supporting cells surrounding ihcs. saturation of transporters by photolysis of caged d-aspartate failed to elicit transporter currents in ihcs, as did local application of d-aspartate to afferent terminals, indicating that neither presynaptic nor postsynaptic membranes are major sites for glutamate removal. these data indicate that glast in supporting cells is responsible for transmitter uptake at ihc afferent synapses.	dihydrokainate @chemical@ glutamate-aspartate transporters @gene@ @cpr:4@ dihydrokainate @chemical@ glast @gene@ @cpr:4@ dihydrokainate @chemical@ excitatory amino acid transporter 1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ dihydrokainate @chemical@ glutamate transporter-1 @gene@ @cpr:6@ dihydrokainate @chemical@ excitatory amino acid transporter 2 @gene@ @cpr:6@ d,l-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate @chemical@ anion channel @gene@ @cpr:6@ glutamate @chemical@ glast @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamate @chemical@ glutamate-aspartate transporter @gene@ @cpr:9@ l-glutamate @chemical@ glast @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
histamine and asthma: an appraisal based on specific h1-receptor antagonism. h1-receptor antagonists have been utilized, following their initial chemical synthesis in 1933, both in the treatment of conditions in which histamine is considered to be of pathogenic importance and conversely to help elucidate the role of histamine in disease, through an evaluation of their influence on disease expression. while there is considerable indirect evidence to implicate histamine in the pathogenesis of asthma, a critical evaluation of h1-receptor antagonism in this condition has, until recently, proved difficult, as many of the early h1-receptor antagonists possessed additional actions, such as anti-cholinergic, local anaesthetic, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonistic and anti-serotonin activity. in addition, h1-receptor antagonists have been shown to have effects on mast cell function. in low concentrations in vitro, antihistamines have been found to inhibit immunologically stimulated mast cell mediator release, with the ic50 in the nanomolar to micromolar range, while at higher concentrations they induce histamine release. the potency of these drugs in producing such effects is unrelated to their h1-receptor blocking activity. furthermore the sedative effects of these therapeutic agents limit the tolerable administrable dose and thus the degree of h1-receptor blockade achievable within the airways. the recent development of h1-receptor antagonists devoid of clinical sedative effects has enabled the administration of doses of h1-antihistamines which achieve a greater degree of h1-receptor blockade within the airways, thus permitting a better appraisal of the role of histamine in this condition. furthermore, the receptor specificity of many of these agents has been focused such that terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine are devoid of anticholinergic activity and exhibit little alpha-antagonistic or anti-serotonin activity of clinical relevance. however, of these agents both loratadine and cetirizine possess additional actions likely to be of relevance to asthma. pretreatment with loratadine has been shown to reduce the recovery of both histamine and prostaglandin d2 (pgd2) in nasal lavage fluid following nasal allergen challenge, a finding interpreted as indicative of in vivo mast cell stabilization, and cetirizine has been shown in vivo at therapeutic doses to inhibit allergen-induced eosinophil chemotaxis. thus while both these agents offer the potential of an oral therapy for asthma based on an h1-receptor antagonist, their additional actions do not make them ideally suited to the exploration of the role of histamine in asthma.(abstract truncated at 400 words)	histamine @chemical@ h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ histamine @chemical@ h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ histamine @chemical@ h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ histamine @chemical@ h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ histamine @chemical@ h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ histamine @chemical@ h1-receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ 
bovine and ovine gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh)-ii ligand precursors and type ii gnrh receptor genes are functionally inactivated. the decapeptide sequence of gnrh-ii is conserved in all jawed vertebrate species studied to date. new data for cattle (bos taurus) indicates a gene encoding gnrh-ii decapeptide possessing arginine (codon: cgg) rather than tryptophan (tgg) at position three in the mature peptide. this substitution is unique. we confirmed the dna sequence after cloning part of the bovine prepro-gnrh-ii gene. bovine gnrh-ii peptide was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized. it did not bind to mammalian gnrh receptors expressed in different types of cell nor did it exhibit agonist or antagonist properties on types i or ii gnrh receptors expressed in cos-7 cells. bovine primers facilitated cloning of ovine gnrh-ii dna. a premature stop codon (tga) replaces the expected tryptophan codon at position seven of gnrh-ii in sheep dna. thus, both species possess prepro-gnrh-ii genes encoding inactive peptides, as previously described for chimpanzee gnrh-ii. the updated bovine type ii gnrh receptor gene sequence revealed inactivation by frame shifts, premature stop codons, and nucleotide changes specifying nonconservative replacement of amino acid residues, similar to inactivation of sheep type ii gnrh receptor. spliced rna transcripts from the disrupted receptor gene were not detected in bovine pituitary. in contrast, bovine prepro-gnrh-i and type i gnrh receptor genes are intact, encoding well-conserved protein sequences. these findings, and previous descriptions of inactivation of the human type ii gnrh receptor and deletions of prepro-gnrh-ii and type ii gnrh receptor in laboratory rodents, suggest the gnrh-ii system has been replaced by the gnrh-i system or is redundant in certain mammals.	@norel@
effect of bosentan (eta/etb receptor antagonist) on metabolic changes during stress and diabetes. elevated plasma et-1 levels have been reported in several conditions such as stress and diabetes. et-1 is found to cause insulin resistance and to stimulate liver glycogenolysis. the question arises whether et-1 has a role in the metabolic changes occurring in such conditions. to test this, we studied the possible effect of the endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) on serum glucose and insulin levels as well as on liver glycogen contents in normoglycemic stressed animals. in addition, the effect of bosentan on serum glucose and insulin levels in both mild and severely diabetic rats and its effect on insulin-induced hypoglycemia were also determined. restraining water immersion stress was used as a model for severe stress reported to elevate plasma et-1 level. mild diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of streptozotocin (38 mg kg(-1)) while severe diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a higher dose of streptozotocin (45 mg kg(-1)). bosentan partially prevented stress-induced both hyperglycemia and decrease in glycogen content while it completely blocked the stress-induced decrease in insulin level in normoglycemic stressed rats. bosentan also decreased serum glucose level without any effect on insulin secretion in mild diabetic rats and potentiated the hypoglycemic action of insulin.	bosentan @chemical@ eta @gene@ @cpr:6@ bosentan @chemical@ etb @gene@ @cpr:6@ bosentan @chemical@ endothelin receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
searching for preventive measures of cardiovascular events in aged japanese taxi drivers--the daily rhythm of cardiovascular risk factors during a night duty day. previous studies have shown that japanese taxi drivers are exposed to more risk factors and have a higher mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease than other occupational groups. we investigated the effect of night taxi driving with a view to preventing acute events of cardiovascular disease among aged taxi drivers. twenty-nine taxi drivers (41-67 years old) were examined for urine normetanephrine/creatinine, von willebrand factor, anti-thrombin iii, t-plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-complex, hematocrit, blood glucose and blood pressure in the morning and at midnight during a duty day and in the following morning. at the same time, the blood pressure and blood glucose of 46 taxi drivers (43-67 years old) in the morning after a night duty with little sleep and in the morning after daytime work and subsequent night sleep were compared. the results obtained indicate that the aggravation of sympathetic nervous system functions with disturbed circadian rhythms, increased blood coagulation and blood concentration, endothelial injury and the elevation of blood glucose at midnight or the next morning were induced by their night work. these conditions are supposed to favour acute vascular events in aged taxi drivers. preventive measures considered include social support for anticoagulant food and water intake, short exercise and walking as well as taking a rest and a nap during night work.	@norel@
identification of an allosteric modulator of serotonin transporter with novel mechanism of action. serotonin transporters (sert) play an essential role in the termination and regulation of serotonin signaling in the brain. sert is also the target of antidepressants and psychostimulants. molecules with novel activities and modes of interaction with regard to sert function are of great scientific and clinical interest. we explored structural regions outside the putative serotonin translocation pathway to identify potential binding sites for allosteric transporter modulators (atms). mutational studies revealed a pocket of amino acids outside the orthosteric substrate binding sites located in the interface between extracellular loops 1 and 3 that when mutated affect transporter function. using the structure of the bacterial transporter homologue leucine transporter as a template, we developed a structural model of sert. we performed molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the allosteric pocket that was identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies and employed this pocket in a virtual screen for small-molecule modulators of sert function. in functional transport assays, we found that one of the identified molecules, atm7, increased the reuptake of serotonin, possibly by facilitating the interaction of serotonin with transport-ready conformations of sert when concentrations of serotonin were low and rate limiting. in addition, atm7 potentiates 3,4-methylenedioxy-n-methylamphetamine (mdma, "ecstasy")-induced reversed transport by sert. taking advantage of a conformationally sensitive residue in transmembrane domain 6, we demonstrate that atm7 mechanistically stabilizes an outward-facing conformation of sert. taken together these observations demonstrate that atm7 acts through a novel mechanism that involves allosteric modulation of sert function.	serotonin @chemical@ sert @gene@ @cpr:9@ serotonin @chemical@ sert @gene@ @cpr:9@ serotonin @chemical@ sert @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
nanobody-albumin nanoparticles (nanaps) for the delivery of a multikinase inhibitor 17864 to egfr overexpressing tumor cells. a novel, egfr-targeted nanomedicine has been developed in the current study. glutaraldehyde crosslinked albumin nanoparticles with a size of approximately 100nm were loaded with the multikinase inhibitor 17864-l(x)-a platinum-bound sunitinib analogue-which couples the drug to methionine residues of albumin and is released in a reductive environment. albumin nanoparticles were surface-coated with bifunctional polyethylene glycol 3500 (peg) and a nanobody-the single variable domain of an antibody-(ega1) against the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr). ega1-peg functionalized nanoparticles showed a 40-fold higher binding to egfr-positive 14c squamous head and neck cancer cells in comparison to pegylated nanoparticles. 17864-l(x) loaded ega1-peg nanoparticles were internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and ultimately digested in lysosomes. the intracellular routing of ega1 targeted nanoparticles leads to a successful release of the kinase inhibitor in the cell and inhibition of proliferation whereas the non-targeted formulations had no antiproliferative effects on 14c cells. the drug loaded targeted nanoparticles were as effective as the free drug in vitro. these results demonstrate that multikinase inhibitor loaded nanoparticles are interesting nanomedicines for the treatment of egfr-positive cancers.	17864 @chemical@ multikinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 17864 @chemical@ multikinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
bile acids induce cdx2 expression through the farnesoid x receptor in gastric epithelial cells. clinical and experimental studies showed that the reflux of bile into the stomach contributes to the induction of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach and gastric carcinogenesis. caudal-type homeobox 2 (cdx2) plays a key role in the exhibition of intestinal phenotypes by regulating the expression of intestine-specific genes such as goblet-specific gene mucin 2 (muc2). we investigated the involvement of the farnesoid x receptor (fxr), a nuclear receptor for bile acids, in the chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca)-induced expression of cdx2 and muc2 in normal rat gastric epithelial cells (rgm-1 cells). rgm-1 cells were treated with cdca or gw4064, an fxr agonist, in the presence or absence of guggulsterone, an fxr antagonist. cdca induced dose-dependent expression of cdx2 and muc2 at both the mrna and protein levels. the maximum stimulation of cdx2 and muc2 mrna induced by cdca was observed at 3 h and by 6 h, respectively. gw4064 also induced expression of these molecules. the effects of cdca and gw4064 on expression of cdx2 and muc2 were abolished by guggulsterone. these findings suggest that bile acids may induce gastric intestinal metaplasia and carcinogenesis through the fxr.	chenodeoxycholic acid @chemical@ cdx2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ chenodeoxycholic acid @chemical@ muc2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdca @chemical@ cdx2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdca @chemical@ muc2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdca @chemical@ cdx2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdca @chemical@ muc2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdca @chemical@ cdx2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cdca @chemical@ muc2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ guggulsterone @chemical@ cdx2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ guggulsterone @chemical@ muc2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ cdca @chemical@ fxr @gene@ @cpr:5@ gw4064 @chemical@ fxr @gene@ @cpr:5@ guggulsterone @chemical@ fxr @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
donepezil hydrochloride: a treatment drug for alzheimer's disease. the role of the cholinergic system with respect to cognitive deficits characteristic of alzheimer's disease (ad) has led to a number of studies focusing on the development of acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitors as a drug for treating this disease. the earliest known ache inhibitors, namely, physostigmine and tacrine, performed poorly in clinical trials (e.g., poor oral activity, brain penetration, and hepatotoxic liability). studies were then focused on finding a new type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that would overcome the disadvantages of these two compounds. donepezil hydrochloride inaugurates a new class of ache inhibitors with longer and more selective action and with manageable adverse effects.	physostigmine @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:4@ tacrine @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:4@ donepezil hydrochloride @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
effect of gene disruptions of the tca cycle on production of succinic acid in saccharomyces cerevisiae. succinate is the main taste component produced by yeasts during sake (japanese rice wine) fermentation. the pathway leading to accumulation of succinate was examined in liquid culture in the presence of a high concentration (15%) of glucose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using a series of saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in which various genes that encode the expression of enzymes required in tca cycle were disrupted. when cultured in ypd medium containing 15% glucose under aerobic conditions, the kgd1 (alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) gene disrupted mutant produced a lower level of succinate than the wild-type strain, while the sdh1 (succinate dehydrogenase) gene-disrupted mutant produced an increased level of succinate. on the other hand, the fum1 (fumarase) gene disrupted mutant produced significantly higher levels of fumarate but did not form malate at all. these results indicate that succinate, fumarate and malate are mainly synthesized through the tca cycle (oxidative direction) even in the presence of glucose at a concentration as high as 15%. when the growth condition was shifted from aerobic to anaerobic, the increased level of succinate in sdh1 disruptants was no longer observed, whereas the decreased level of succinate in the kgd1 diruptant was still observed. a double mutant of the two fumarate reductase isozyme genes (osm1 and frds) showed a succinate productivity of 50% as compared to the parent when cells were incubated in glucose-buffered solution. these results indicate that succinate could be synthesized through two pathways, namely, alpha-ketoglutarate oxidation via the tca cycle and fumarate reduction under anaerobic conditions.	succinate @chemical@ kgd1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ sdh1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ succinate dehydrogenase @gene@ @cpr:9@ fumarate @chemical@ fum1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ fumarate @chemical@ fumarase @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ sdh1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ kgd1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ fumarate reductase @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ osm1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ succinate @chemical@ frds @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
in vitro inhibitory effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronidation in recombinant human udp-glucuronosyltransferase 1a9--potent inhibition by niflumic acid. the inhibitory potencies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) on udp-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) 1a9 activity were investigated in recombinant human ugt1a9 using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-mu) as a substrate for glucuronidation. 4-mu glucuronidation (4-mug) showed michaelis-menten kinetics with a km value of 6.7 microm. the inhibitory effects of the following seven nsaids were investigated: acetaminophen, diclofenac, diflunisal, indomethacin, ketoprofen, naproxen and niflumic acid. niflumic acid had the most potent inhibitory effect on 4-mug with an ic50 value of 0.0341 microm. the ic50 values of diflunisal, diclofenac and indomethacin were 1.31, 24.2, and 34.1 microm, respectively, while acetaminophen, ketoprofen and naproxen showed less potent inhibition. niflumic acid, diflunisal, diclofenac and indomethacin inhibited 4-mug competitively with ki values of 0.0275, 0.710, 53.3 and 69.9 microm, respectively, being similar to each ic50 value. in conclusion, of the seven nsaids investigated, niflumic acid was the most potent inhibitor of recombinant ugt1a9 via 4-mug in a competitive manner.	niflumic acid @chemical@ ugt1a9 @gene@ @cpr:4@ niflumic acid @chemical@ human udp-glucuronosyltransferase 1a9 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
enhancing raman scattering without plasmons: unprecedented sensitivity achieved by tio2 shell-based resonators. a remarkable enhancement of raman scattering is achieved by tio2 shell-based spherical resonators in the absence of plasmonic enhancers. this effect is ascribed to the synergistic combination of high refractive index of the shell layer, multiple light scattering through the spheres, and related geometrical factors and can be exploited to fabricate a new generation of self-diagnostic, recyclable sers-active substrates.	@norel@
aldosterone-induced enac and basal na(+)/k(+)-atpase trafficking via protein kinase d1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinaseiiiβ trans golgi signalling in m1 cortical collecting duct cells. aldosterone regulates na(+) transport in the distal nephron through multiple mechanisms that include the transcriptional control of epithelial sodium channel (enac) and na(+)/k(+)-atpase subunits. aldosterone also induces the rapid phosphorylation of protein kinase d1 (pkd1). pkd isoforms regulate protein trafficking, by the control of vesicle fission from the trans golgi network (tgn) through activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinaseiiiβ (pi4kiiiβ). we report rapid enacγ translocation to the plasma membrane after 30min aldosterone treatment in polarized m1 cortical collecting duct cells, which was significantly impaired in pkd1 shrna-mediated knockdown cells. in pkd1-deficient cells, the ouabain-sensitive current was significantly reduced and na(+)/k(+)-atpase α and β subunits showed aberrant localization. pkd1 and pi4kiiiβ localize to the tgn, and aldosterone induced an interaction between pkd1 and pi4kiiiβ following aldosterone treatment. this study reveals a novel mechanism for rapid regulation of enac and the na(+)/k(+)-atpase, via directed trafficking through pkd1-pi4kiiiβ signalling at the level of the tgn.	aldosterone @chemical@ protein kinase d1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ aldosterone @chemical@ pkd1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ aldosterone @chemical@ enac @gene@ @cpr:3@ aldosterone @chemical@ na(+)/k(+)-atpase @gene@ @cpr:3@

molecular and functional characterization of flavin-containing monooxygenases in cynomolgus macaque. flavin-containing monooxygenases (fmos), drug-metabolizing enzymes essential for the metabolism of endogenous biochemicals and foreign compounds, have been characterized in human (including fmo1-5 and fmo6p), but remain to be investigated in cynomolgus macaque. in this study, cdnas of cynomolgus fmo1-5 and fmo6 were isolated and characterized. amino acid sequences of cynomolgus fmo1-5, respectively, shared high sequence identities (94-98%) and were closely clustered in a phylogenetic tree, with human fmo1-5. eight different transcripts, due to alternative splicing, were isolated for cynomolgus fmo6, which is highly identical (∼96%) to human fmo6p. among the 10 tissue types analyzed, cynomolgus fmo1, fmo2, fmo4, and fmo6 were most abundantly expressed in kidney, while cynomolgus fmo3 and fmo5 were most abundantly expressed in liver. in kidney and liver, the most abundantly expressed cynomolgus fmo genes were fmo1 and fmo3 respectively. cynomolgus fmo1, fmo2, fmo3, and fmo5 metabolized benzydamine, and fmo1/fmo3 and fmo3 also metabolized methimazole and trimethylamine, respectively. rates of benzydamine n-oxygenation (catalyzed by fmo3) varied (approximately 20-fold) among the 28 cynomolgus livers and were significantly correlated with fmo3 protein expression, indicating that the inter-animal variations in benzydamine n-oxygenation might be partly accounted for by the variable fmo3 expression. cynomolgus fmo6 metabolized benzydamine only slightly, but minimal expression of fmo6 in all tissue precludes the importance of fmo6 in drug metabolism, unlike cynomolgus fmo1, fmo2, fmo3, and fmo5 which were all functional. abundant expression of fmo1 and fmo3 in kidney and liver, respectively, suggest their importance in drug metabolism in cynomolgus macaque, similar to human.	benzydamine @chemical@ cynomolgus fmo1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo5 @gene@ @cpr:9@ methimazole @chemical@ fmo1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ methimazole @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ methimazole @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ trimethylamine @chemical@ fmo1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ trimethylamine @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ trimethylamine @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ n @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ n @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ cynomolgus fmo6 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo3 @gene@ @cpr:9@ benzydamine @chemical@ fmo5 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
conivaptan: a dual vasopressin receptor v1a/v2 antagonist [corrected]. several fluid retentive states such as heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are associated with inappropriate elevation in plasma levels of arginine vasopressin (avp), a neuropeptide that is secreted by the hypothalamus and plays a critical role in the regulation of serum osmolality and in circulatory homeostasis. the actions of avp are mediated by three receptor subtypes v1a, v2, and v1b. the v1a receptor regulates vasodilation and cellular hypertrophy while the v2 receptor regulates free water excretion. the v1b receptor regulates adrenocorticotropin hormone release. conivaptan is a nonpeptide dual v1a/v2 avp receptor antagonist. it binds with high affinity, competitively, and reversibly to the v1a/v2 receptor subtypes; its antagonistic effect is concentration dependent. it inhibits cyp3a4 liver enzyme and elevates plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. it is approved only for short-term intravenous use. infusion site reaction is the most common reason for discontinuation of the drug. in animals conivaptan increased urine volume and free water clearance. in heart failure models it improved hemodynamic parameters and free water excretion. conivaptan has been shown to correct hyponatremia in euvolemic or hypervolemic patients. its efficacy and safety for short-term use have led to the food and drug administration (fda) approval of its intravenous form for the correction of hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic states. despite its ability to block the action of avp on v1a receptors, no demonstrable benefit from this action was noted in patients with chronic compensated heart failure and it is not approved for this indication. consideration should be given to further evaluation of its potential benefits in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.	conivaptan @chemical@ v1a/v2 avp receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ conivaptan @chemical@ vasopressin receptor v1a/v2 @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
stereospecific inhibition of monoamine uptake transporters by meta-hydroxyephedrine isomers. meta-hydroxyephedrine (hed) comprises four stereoisomers consisting of two enantiomeric pairs related to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. hed is transported into adrenergic neurons and radiolabeled hed has been employed in positron emission tomography (pet) to image adrenergic neurons in vivo. to extend structure-activity analyses of binding sites within monoamine transporters and to determine which stereoisomer displayed the best selectivity for pet imaging applications, we tested the hed compounds for their abilities to inhibit [(3)h]neurotransmitter uptake into platelets, transfected cells, and chromaffin vesicles. we hypothesized that the hed compounds would be most potent at the norepinephrine transporter (net) compared to the serotonin or dopamine transporters and that the 1r diastereomers would be more effective than 1s diastereomers. supporting the hypotheses, all stereoisomers were most potent at the net and the 1r,2s stereoisomer was the most potent inhibitor overall. however, the 1s,2r isomer may be preferred for pet applications because of better selectivity among the transporters and reduced neuronal recycling.	hed @chemical@ norepinephrine transporter @gene@ @cpr:4@ hed @chemical@ net @gene@ @cpr:4@ meta-hydroxyephedrine @chemical@ monoamine uptake transporters @gene@ @cpr:4@ hed @chemical@ monoamine transporters @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
2-aminothiazoles with improved pharmacotherapeutic properties for treatment of prion disease. recently, we described the aminothiazole lead (4-biphenyl-4-ylthiazol-2-yl)-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-amine (1), which exhibits many desirable properties, including excellent stability in liver microsomes, oral bioavailability of ∼40 %, and high exposure in the brains of mice. despite its good pharmacokinetic properties, compound 1 exhibited only modest potency in mouse neuroblastoma cells overexpressing the disease-causing prion protein prp(sc) . accordingly, we sought to identify analogues of 1 with improved antiprion potency in scn2a-cl3 cells while retaining similar or superior properties. herein we report the discovery of improved lead compounds such as (6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-[4-(4-pyridin-3-yl-phenyl)thiazol-2-yl]amine and cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (4-biphenylthiazol-2-yl)amide, which exhibit brain exposure/ec50 ratios at least tenfold greater than that of compound 1.	@norel@
alpha-linolenic acid, delta6-desaturase gene polymorphism, and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. background: delta(6)-desaturase (fads2) is the rate-limiting step in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) biosynthetic pathway. objective: the aim was to test whether the common deletion [t/-] in the promoter of fads2 affects the pufa biosynthetic pathway and consequently modifies the effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ala) on myocardial infarction (mi). design: case subjects (n =1694) with a first nonfatal acute mi were matched by age, sex, and area of residence to 1694 population-based control subjects in costa rica. pufas were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography from plasma and adipose tissue samples. least-squares means from generalized linear models and odds ratios (ors) and 95% cis from multiple conditional logistic regression models were estimated. results: the prevalence of the variant t/- allele was 48%. eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid decreased in adipose tissue and plasma with increasing number of copies of the variant allele with a monotonic trend (p < 0.05 for all). fasting plasma triacylglycerols by genotype were 2.08 mmol/l for tt, 2.16 mmol/l for t-, and 2.26 mmol/l for - - [ie, homozygous for the variant (deletion) allele] (p = 0.03). the fads2 deletion was not associated with mi and did not significantly modify the association between adipose tissue ala and the risk of mi. conclusions: the fads2 deletion may prevent the conversion of ala into very-long-chain pufas. however, this metabolic effect is not translated into an attenuated risk between ala and mi among carriers of the variant. it is possible that, at current intakes of ala, any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the availability of substrate. further research in populations deficient in ala intake is warranted.	pufa @chemical@ fads2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alpha-linolenic acid @chemical@ fads2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ ala @chemical@ fads2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
histone deacetylase 3 is required for maintenance of bone mass during aging. histone deacetylase 3 (hdac3) is a nuclear enzyme that removes acetyl groups from lysine residues in histones and other proteins to epigenetically regulate gene expression. hdac3 interacts with bone-related transcription factors and co-factors such as runx2 and zfp521, and thus is poised to play a key role in the skeletal system. to understand the role of hdac3 in osteoblasts and osteocytes, hdac3 conditional knockout (cko) mice were created with the osteocalcin (ocn) promoter driving cre expression. hdac3 cko(ocn) mice were of normal size and weight, but progressively lost trabecular and cortical bone mass with age. the hdac3 cko(ocn) mice exhibited reduced cortical bone mineralization and material properties and suffered frequent fractures. bone resorption was lower, not higher, in the hdac3 cko(ocn) mice, suggesting that primary defects in osteoblasts caused the reduced bone mass. indeed, reductions in bone formation were observed. osteoblasts and osteocytes from hdac3 cko(ocn) mice showed increased dna damage and reduced functional activity in vivo and in vitro. thus, hdac3 expression in osteoblasts and osteocytes is essential for bone maintenance during aging.	@norel@
store-operated ca2+ entry (soce) induced by protease-activated receptor-1 mediates stim1 phosphorylation to inhibit soce in endothelial cells through amp-activated protein kinase and p38beta mitogen-activated protein kinase. the ca2+ sensor stim1 is crucial for activation of store-operated ca2+ entry (soce) through trpc and orai channels. stim1 phosphorylation serves as an off-switch for soce. however, the signaling pathway for stim1 phosphorylation is unknown. here we show that soce activates amp-activated protein kinase (ampk); its effector p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38β mapk) phosphorylates stim1, thus inhibiting soce in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (ecs). activation of ampk using aicar resulted in stim1 phosphorylation on serine residues and prevented par-1-induced ca2+ entry. further, aicar pretreatment blocked par-1-induced increase in permeability of mouse-lung microvessels. activation of soce with thrombin caused phosphorylation of isoform α1, but not α2 of the ampk catalytic subunit. moreover, knockdown of ampkα1 augmented soce induced by thrombin. interestingly, sb203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 mapk, blocked stim1 phosphorylation and led to sustained stim1-puncta formation and ca2+ entry. of the three p38 mapk isoforms expressed in ecs, p38β knockdown prevented par-1-mediated stim1 phosphorylation and potentiated soce. in addition, inhibition of the soce downstream target camkkβ or knockdown of ampkα1 suppressed par-1-mediated phosphorylation of p38β and hence stim1. thus, our findings demonstrate that soce activates camkkβ-ampkα1-p38β mapk signaling to phosphorylate stim1, thereby suppressing endothelial soce and permeability responses.	aicar @chemical@ ampk @gene@ @cpr:3@ aicar @chemical@ stim1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ aicar @chemical@ par-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ aicar @chemical@ par-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sb203580 @chemical@ p38 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sb203580 @chemical@ mapk @gene@ @cpr:4@ sb203580 @chemical@ stim1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
theoretical study of the decomposition of ethyl and ethyl 3-phenyl glycidate. the mechanism of the decomposition of ethyl and ethyl 3-phenyl glycidate in gas phase was studied by density functional theory (dft) and mp2 methods. a proposed mechanism for the reaction indicates that the ethyl side of the ester is eliminated as ethylene through a concerted six-membered cyclic transition state, and the unstable intermediate glycidic acid decarboxylates rapidly to give the corresponding aldehyde. two possible pathways for glycidic acid decarboxylation were studied: one via a five-membered cyclic transition state, and the other via a four-membered cyclic transition state. the results of the calculations indicate that the decarboxylation reaction occurs via a mechanism with five-membered cyclic transition state.	@norel@
diethylcarbamazine activity against brugia malayi microfilariae is dependent on inducible nitric-oxide synthase and the cyclooxygenase pathway. background: diethylcarbamazine (dec) has been used for many years in the treatment of human lymphatic filariasis. its mode of action is not well understood, but it is known to interact with the arachidonic acid pathway. here we have investigated the contribution of the nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase (cox) pathways to the activity of dec against b. malayi microfilariae in mice. methods: b. malayi microfilariae were injected intravenously into mice and parasitaemia was measured 24 hours later. dec was then administered to balb/c mice with and without pre-treatment with indomethacin or dexamethasone and the parasitaemia monitored. to investigate a role for inducible nitric oxide in dec's activity, dec and ivermectin were administered to microfilaraemic inos-/- mice and their background strain (129/sv). western blot analysis was used to determine any effect of dec on the production of cox and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (inos) proteins. results: dec administered alone to balb/c mice resulted in a rapid and profound reduction in circulating microfilariae within five minutes of treatment. microfilarial levels began to recover after 24 hours and returned to near pre-treatment levels two weeks later, suggesting that the sequestration of microfilariae occurs independently of parasite killing. pre-treatment of animals with dexamethasone or indomethacin reduced dec's efficacy by almost 90% or 56%, respectively, supporting a role for the arachidonic acid and cyclooxygenase pathways in vivo. furthermore, experiments showed that treatment with dec results in a reduction in the amount of cox-1 protein in peritoneal exudate cells. additionally, in inos-/- mice infected with b. malayi microfilariae, dec showed no activity, whereas the efficacy of another antifilarial drug, ivermectin, was unaffected. conclusion: these results confirm the important role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in dec's mechanism of action in vivo and show that in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, it targets the cyclooxygenase pathway and cox-1. moreover, we show for the first time that inducible nitric oxide is essential for the rapid sequestration of microfilariae by dec.	dec @chemical@ cox-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@

tub has a key role in insulin and leptin signaling and action in vivo in hypothalamic nuclei. mutation of tub gene in mice induces obesity, suggesting that tub could be an important regulator of energy balance. in the current study, we investigated whether insulin, leptin, and obesity can modulate tub in vivo in hypothalamic nuclei, and we investigated possible consequences on energy balance, neuropeptide expression, and hepatic glucose metabolism. food intake, metabolic characteristics, signaling proteins, and neuropeptide expression were measured in response to fasting and refeeding, intracerebroventricular insulin and leptin, and tub antisense oligonucleotide (aso). tub tyrosine phosphorylation (tub-p-tyr) is modulated by nutritional status. tub is a substrate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (irtk) and leptin receptor (lepr)-janus kinase 2 (jak2) in hypothalamic nuclei. after leptin or insulin stimulation, tub translocates to the nucleus. inhibition of tub expression in hypothalamus by aso increased food intake, fasting blood glucose, and hepatic glucose output, decreased o(2) consumption, and blunted the effect of insulin or leptin on proopiomelanocortin, thyroid-releasing hormone, melanin-concentrating hormone, and orexin expression. in hypothalamus of mice administered a high-fat diet, there is a reduction in leptin and insulin-induced tub-p-tyr and nuclear translocation, which is reversed by reducing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b expression. these results indicate that tub has a key role in the control of insulin and leptin effects on food intake, and the modulation of tub may contribute to insulin and leptin resistance in dio mice.	@norel@
indomethacin activates carbonic anhydrase and antagonizes the effect of the specific carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, by a direct mechanism of action. objectives: in this paper we investigated the effect of indomethacin, acetazolamide and their combination in vitro and in vivo on carbonic anhydrase (ca) isozymes. method: in vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) m on purified human red cell ca i and ii as well as on human gastric mucosa ca iv using dose-response relationships. kinetic studies were also performed. the effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell ca and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. results: indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte ca i and ca ii activity. acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of ca, reduces the activity of ca i and ca ii from red cells. indomethacin completely antagonizes ca activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on ca. in humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte ca ii activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. conclusions: our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitor, is also an activator of ca. our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of ca but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. in view of the role of ca in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular ph, our results suggest that: firstly, ca activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in cox activity; secondly, pgs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in cox activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.	indomethacin @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ carbonic anhydrase @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ carbonic anhydrase @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ ca i @gene@ @cpr:3@ indomethacin @chemical@ ca ii @gene@ @cpr:3@ acetazolamide @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ ca i @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ ca ii @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ carbonic anhydrase @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ carbonic anhydrase @gene@ @cpr:4@ indomethacin @chemical@ cyclooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ indomethacin @chemical@ cox @gene@ @cpr:4@ acetazolamide @chemical@ ca @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
dopamine d2 receptor occupancy by risperidone: implications for the timing and magnitude of clinical response. the objective of the study is to investigate whether dopamine d2 receptor occupancy by risperidone and plasma levels over time can account for therapeutic efficacy and the latency period to response. thirty-eight examinations with (123)i-ibzm single photon emission computed tomography were performed on 22 patients with schizophrenia, at diagnosis, 48 h after starting risperidone treatment and at a stable dose. risperidone plasma levels were determined and psychopathologic evaluations (brief psychiatric rating scale, positive and negative syndrome scale) were carried out. no differences in the striatal/occipital (s/o) ratio or plasma levels were found between examinations at the 48-h time point and when a stable dose level had been established, so these parameters could not account for the latency period required for clinical response. d2 receptor occupancy at 48 h correlated positively with clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. therefore, if these results are confirmed, d2 receptor occupancy at the beginning of treatment with risperidone may be a predictor of subsequent clinical response.	@norel@
suppression of src/erk and gsk-3/β-catenin signaling by pinosylvin inhibits the growth of human colorectal cancer cells. pinosylvin, a naturally occurring trans-stilbenoid mainly found in pinus species, has exhibited a potential cancer chemopreventive activity. however, the growth inhibitory activity against cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. therefore, the anti-proliferative activity of pinosylvin was investigated in human colorectal hct 116 cancer cells. pinosylvin inhibited the proliferation of hct 116 cells by arresting transition of cell cycle from g1 to s phase along with the downregulation of cyclin d1, cyclin e, cyclin a, cyclin dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), cdk4, c-myc, and retinoblastoma protein (prb), and the upregulation of p21(waf1/cip1) and p53. pinosylvin was also found to attenuate the activation of proteins involved in focal adhesion kinase (fak)/c-src/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) signaling, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt/ glycogen synthase kinase 3β (gsk-3β) signaling pathway. subsequently, pinosylvin suppressed the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, one of downstream molecules of pi3k/akt/gsk-3β signaling, and these events led to the sequential downregulation of β-catenin-mediated transcription of target genes including bmp4, id2, survivin, cyclin d1, mmp7, and c-myc. these findings demonstrate that the anti-proliferative activity of pinosylvin might be associated with the cell cycle arrest and downregulation of cell proliferation regulating signaling pathways in human colorectal cancer cells.	pinosylvin @chemical@ p21 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pinosylvin @chemical@ waf1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cip1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pinosylvin @chemical@ p53 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cyclin d1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cyclin e @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cyclin a @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cyclin dependent kinase 2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cdk2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cdk4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ c-myc @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ retinoblastoma protein @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ prb @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ src @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ erk @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ gsk-3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ β-catenin @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ ocal adhesion kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ fak @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ c-src @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ extracellular signal-regulated kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ erk @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ phosphoinositide 3-kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ pi3k @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ akt @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ glycogen synthase kinase 3β @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ gsk-3β @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ β-catenin @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ pi3k @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ akt @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ gsk-3β @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ β-catenin @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ bmp4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ id2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ survivin @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ cyclin d1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ mmp7 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pinosylvin @chemical@ c-myc @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
qm/mm simulations of vibrational spectra of bacteriorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin-2. channelrhodopsin-2 is a light-gated ion channel, which has been studied intensively over the last decade. vibrational spectroscopic experiments started to shed light on the structural changes, that occur during the photocycle, especially in the hydrogen-bonded network surrounding the protonated d156 and c128 - the dc gate. however, the interpretation of these experiments was only based on homology models. since then, an x-ray structure and better computational models became available. in this article, we show that in combination with a recent reparametrization, the approximate dft method, dftb, is able to describe the effects of hydrogen bonding on the c[double bond, length as m-dash]o stretch vibration in carboxylic acids reliably and agrees well with full dft results. we apply dftb in a qm/mm framework to perform vibrational analysis of buried aspartic acids in bacteriorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin-2. using this approach, we can simulate the ftir spectral difference between d115 in the dark-adapted and k states of bacteriorhodopsin. the ftir experiments on the dc gate in channelrhodopsin-2 are well described using an indirect model, where d156 and c128 are bridged via a water molecule.	@norel@
atr regulates a g2-phase cell-cycle checkpoint in arabidopsis thaliana. ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and rad3-related (atr) plays a central role in cell-cycle regulation, transmitting dna damage signals to downstream effectors of cell-cycle progression. in animals, atr is an essential gene. here, we find that arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) atr-/- mutants were viable, fertile, and phenotypically wild-type in the absence of exogenous dna damaging agents but exhibit altered expression of atrnr1 (ribonucleotide reductase large subunit) and alteration of some damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints. atr mutants were hypersensitive to hydroxyurea (hu), aphidicolin, and uv-b light but only mildly sensitive to gamma-radiation. g2 arrest was observed in response to gamma-irradiation in both wild-type and atr plants, albeit with slightly different kinetics, suggesting that atr plays a secondary role in response to double-strand breaks. g2 arrest also was observed in wild-type plants in response to aphidicolin but was defective in atr mutants, resulting in compaction of nuclei and subsequent cell death. by contrast, hu-treated wild-type and atr plants arrested in g1 and showed no obvious signs of cell death. we propose that, in plants, hu invokes a novel checkpoint responsive to low levels of deoxynucleotide triphosphates. these results demonstrate the important role of cell-cycle checkpoints in the ability of plant cells to sense and cope with problems associated with dna replication.	@norel@
pre-steady-state currents in neutral amino acid transporters induced by photolysis of a new caged alanine derivative. na+-dependent transmembrane transport of small neutral amino acids, such as glutamine and alanine, is mediated, among others, by the neutral amino acid transporters of the solute carrier 1 [slc1, alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 (asct1), and asct2] and slc38 families [sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 (snat1), snat2, and snat4]. many mechanistic aspects of amino acid transport by these systems are not well-understood. here, we describe a new photolabile alanine derivative based on protection of alanine with the 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (mni) caging group, which we use for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of alanine transport by asct2, snat1, and snat2. mni-alanine has favorable photochemical properties and is stable in aqueous solution. it is also inert with respect to the transport systems studied. photolytic release of free alanine results in the generation of significant transient current components in hek293 cells expressing the asct2, snat1, and snat2 proteins. in asct2, these currents show biphasic decay with time constants, tau, in the 1-30 ms time range. they are fully inhibited in the absence of extracellular na+, demonstrating that na+ binding to the transporter is necessary for induction of the alanine-mediated current. for snat1, these transient currents differ in their time course (tau = 1.6 ms) from previously described pre-steady-state currents generated by applying steps in the membrane potential (tau approximately 4-5 ms), indicating that they are associated with a fast, previously undetected, electrogenic partial reaction in the snat1 transport cycle. the implications of these results for the mechanisms of transmembrane transport of alanine are discussed. the new caged alanine derivative will provide a useful tool for future, more detailed studies of neutral amino acid transport.	alanine @chemical@ asct2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ snat1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ snat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ asct2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ snat1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ snat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl @chemical@ asct2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl @chemical@ snat1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl @chemical@ snat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ neutral amino acid transporters @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ solute carrier 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ slc1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ asct1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ asct2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ slc38 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ snat1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ snat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ amino acids @chemical@ snat4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ mni @chemical@ asct2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ mni @chemical@ snat1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ mni @chemical@ snat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ neutral amino acid transporters @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ solute carrier 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ slc1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ asct1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ asct2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ slc38 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ snat1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ snat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ glutamine @chemical@ snat4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ neutral amino acid transporters @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ solute carrier 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ slc1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ asct1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ asct2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ snat1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ snat2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ alanine @chemical@ snat4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
effect of bisphenol-a on insulin signal transduction and glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle of adult male albino rat. the estrogenic monomer bisphenol-a (bpa) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical used in the production of epoxy resins, plastic food and beverage containers, leading to ubiquitous human exposure. environmentally relevant doses of bpa have profound effects on mice endocrine pancreas. it increases pancreatic insulin content and favors postprandial hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in male mice. skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic glucose metabolism. in the present study, we investigated the possible effects of bpa on insulin-signaling molecules and glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle of male rat. adult male wistar albino rats were divided into three groups. group i: control (vehicle treated) and groups ii and iii were administered with bpa orally (20 and 200 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). although there was no change in the levels of insulin receptor (ir), akt (protein kinase b) and glucose transporter-4 (glut4) messenger rna, bpa significantly decreased the ir, akt and glut4 protein levels (both plasma membrane and cytosolic fraction) of the gastrocnemius muscle. there was an increase in serum insulin and decrease in serum testosterone levels but fasting blood glucose level remained unaltered. in conclusion, bpa has adverse effects on phosphorylation of akt, glut4 translocation and (14)c-glucose oxidation.	bpa @chemical@ akt @gene@ @cpr:4@ bpa @chemical@ glut4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ bpa @chemical@ ir @gene@ @cpr:4@ bpa @chemical@ glut4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ bpa @chemical@ akt @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
cyclopentenone prostaglandins suppress activation of microglia: down-regulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase by 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin j2. mechanisms leading to down-regulation of activated microglia and astrocytes are poorly understood, in spite of the potentially detrimental role of activated glia in neurodegeneration. prostaglandins, produced both by neurons and glia, may serve as mediators of glial and neuronal functions. we examined the influence of cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their precursors on activated glia. as models of glial activation, production of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (inos) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line bv-2, and il-1beta-stimulated rat astrocytes. cyclopentenone prostaglandins were potent inhibitors of inos induction and were more effective than their precursors, prostaglandins e2 and d2. 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin j2 (15d-pgj2) was the most potent prostaglandin among those tested. in activated microglia, 15d-pgj2 suppressed inos promoter activity, inos mrna, and protein levels. the action of 15d-pgj2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppargamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of ppargamma, was unable to inhibit inos induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-pgj2 could stimulate the activity of a ppar-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected ppargamma. 15d-pgj2 did not block nuclear translocation or dna-binding activity of the transcription factor nfkappab, but it did inhibit the activity of an nfkappab reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial inos by 15d-pgj2 may involve interference with nfkappab transcriptional activity in the nucleus. thus, our data suggest the existence of a novel pathway mediated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which may represent part of a feedback mechanism leading to the cessation of inflammatory glial responses in the brain.	15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin j2 @chemical@ inducible nitric-oxide synthase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 15d-pgj2 @chemical@ inos @gene@ @cpr:4@ cyclopentenone prostaglandins @chemical@ inducible nitric-oxide synthase @gene@ @cpr:4@ cyclopentenone prostaglandins @chemical@ inos @gene@ @cpr:4@ prostaglandins e2 and d2 @chemical@ inos @gene@ @cpr:4@ 15d-pgj2 @chemical@ inos promoter @gene@ @cpr:4@ 15d-pgj2 @chemical@ nfkappab @gene@ @cpr:4@ 15d-pgj2 @chemical@ inos @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the effects of adulthood olanzapine treatment on cognitive performance and neurotrophic factor content in male and female rats neonatally treated with quinpirole. male and female sprague-dawley rats were administered quinpirole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day (p)1 to p21. this drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the d2 receptor. beginning on p62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. one day after olanzapine treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the morris water maze (mwm) for seven consecutive days. dopamine d2 receptor priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a d2 receptor-mediated event, before olanzapine was administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. results showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment induced d2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. on the mwm place version, d2-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the mwm. there were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal ngf, bdnf and chat that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in bdnf and chat in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment. these results show that olanzapine eliminates d2 receptor priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by d2 priming in the hippocampus.	quinpirole @chemical@ d2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ olanzapine @chemical@ ngf @gene@ @cpr:3@ olanzapine @chemical@ bdnf @gene@ @cpr:3@ olanzapine @chemical@ chat @gene@ @cpr:3@ olanzapine @chemical@ d2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinpirole @chemical@ ngf @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinpirole @chemical@ bdnf @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinpirole @chemical@ chat @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinpirole @chemical@ bdnf @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinpirole @chemical@ chat @gene@ @cpr:4@ olanzapine @chemical@ d2 receptor @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
pyridoxal 5'-phosphate may be curative in early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. neonatal epileptic encephalopathy can be caused by inborn errors of metabolism. these conditions are often unresponsive to treatment with conventional antiepileptic drugs. six children with pyridox(am)ine-5'-phosphate oxidase (pnpo) deficiency presented with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. two were treated with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp) within the first month of life and showed normal development or moderate psychomotor retardation thereafter. four children with late or no treatment died or showed severe mental handicap. all of the children showed atypical biochemical findings. prompt treatment with plp in all neonates and infants with epileptic encephalopathy should become mandatory, permitting normal development in at least some of those affected with pnpo deficiency.	@norel@
association of atp-binding cassette transporter variants with the risk of alzheimer's disease. aim: a number of studies have demonstrated that abcb1 and bcrp (abcg2) actively transport aβ. we aimed to investigate the association of genetic variants of selected multidrug transporters with alzheimer's disease (ad) in histopathologically confirmed ad cases and controls. materials & methods: dna from brain tissue of 71 ad cases with consortium to establish a registry for alzheimer's disease (cerad) neuropathological stages b/c and 81 controls was genotyped for selected variants in abca1, abca7, abcb1, abcc2 and abcg2. in addition, the apoe4 status was analyzed. results: the novel abca7 snp, rs3752246, tended to be associated with ad in our study. variants in abcb1 were significantly less frequent in ad cases older than 65 years of age and among females. this association of abcb1 2677g>t (rs2032582) was more pronounced in apoe4-negative cases (p = 0.005). however, only abcc2 3972c>t (rs3740066) was significantly associated with ad risk after logistic regression analysis including all variants. other transporters showed a lack of association. conclusion: our results support the hypothesis that abcb1 and possibly other abc-transporters are involved in the process of aβ accumulation in the aging brain and may modulate the risk for ad in an allele-specific manner, and thus might represent a new target for prevention and treatment of ad. original submitted 8 october 2012; revision submitted 22 january 2013.	@norel@
impaired antibody synthesis after spinal cord injury is level dependent and is due to sympathetic nervous system dysregulation. individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) are highly susceptible to infection. this post-traumatic immune suppression is thought to occur via alterations in sympathetic nervous system (sns) or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis function. normally, the hpa axis and sns help coordinate proper immune function. after sci, the hpa axis becomes activated and descending input to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (spns) is impaired. because lymphoid organs are innervated by spns distributed throughout the thoracolumbar spinal cord, we predicted level-dependent immune suppression after sci due to activation of the hpa axis and loss of descending input to spns. we tested this hypothesis by measuring indices of hpa (circulating corticosterone; cort) and sns function (norepinephrine (ne) in spleen) as well as antigen-specific antibody synthesis against an exogenous non-self protein following high- or low-level sci. using a mid-thoracic (t9) spinal contusion injury model, we found that cort was elevated after sci with aberrant patterns of diurnal cort synthesis evident through at least the first 24 h post-injury. however, splenic ne and antibody synthesis were similar to uninjured controls. injury severity did not change these parameters. indeed, cort, ne and antibody synthesis were similar after t9 contusion or transection sci. in contrast, high-level sci (t3) caused sustained increases in cort and splenic ne along with impaired antibody synthesis and elevated splenocyte apoptosis. the immunosuppressive effects of t3 sci were caused by ne acting at beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2ar) and could be reversed using beta2ar blockers. interestingly, impaired antibody after t3 sci could be mimicked after t9 sci with a beta2ar agonist. these data illustrate the immunosuppressive effects of the sns after high-level sci and indicate that immune deficits may be overcome using beta-blockers.	@norel@
distal bowel selectivity in the chemoprevention of experimental colon carcinogenesis by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug nabumetone. use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) for chemoprevention of colon cancer has been hindered by their potential gastro-intestinal toxicity. nabumetone, which is approximately 10 to 36 times safer than conventional nsaids, was evaluated in 2 models of experimental colon carcinogenesis. in azoxymethane (aom)-treated fisher 344 rats, nabumetone caused dose-dependent inhibition of aberrant crypt foci (acf), with 750 and 1,500 ppm resulting in 15% and 37% reductions, respectively (p < 0.05). moreover, complex acf were reduced by 48% in the latter group. min mice studies confirmed the chemopreventive efficacy of nabumetone, with 900 ppm suppressing approximately half of the intestinal tumors. interestingly, inhibition of intermediate biomarkers in both models was markedly greater in the distal than the proximal bowel. to mechanistically evaluate this regional selectivity, we assessed cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) expression in the uninvolved mucosa and demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold excess in the distal relative to the proximal bowel in both min mice and aom-treated rats. we then investigated another putative nsaid target, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (ppar-delta) and demonstrated up-regulation during aom-induced colonic tumorigenesis. furthermore, in pre-neoplastic mucosa, there was a 3-fold excess of ppar-delta in the distal colon. we demonstrate that nabumetone is an effective protective agent in both experimental models of colon carcinogenesis. the striking distal predilection of nabumetone may be, at least partially, explained by distal bowel over-expression of cox-2 and ppar-delta.	aom @chemical@ cyclo-oxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ aom @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
robust array-based coregulator binding assay predicting erα-agonist potency and generating binding profiles reflecting ligand structure. testing chemicals for their endocrine-disrupting potential, including interference with estrogen receptor (er) signaling, is an important aspect of chemical safety testing. because of the practical drawbacks of animal testing, the development of in vitro alternatives for the uterotrophic assay and other in vivo (anti)estrogenicity tests has high priority. it was previously demonstrated that an in vitro assay that profiles ligand-induced binding of erα to a microarray of coregulator-derived peptides might be a valuable candidate for a panel of in vitro assays aiming at an ultimate replacement of the uterotrophic assay. in the present study, the reproducibility and robustness of this coregulator binding assay was determined by measuring the binding profiles of 14 model compounds that are recommended by the office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances for testing laboratory proficiency in estrogen receptor transactivation assays. with a median coefficient of variation of 5.0% and excellent correlation (r(2) = 0.993) between duplicate measurements, the reproducibility of the erα-coregulator binding assay was better than the reproducibility of other commonly used in vitro er functional assays. in addition, the coregulator binding assay is correctly predicting the estrogenicity for 13 out of 14 compounds tested. when the potency of the er-agonists to induce erα-coregulator binding was compared to their er binding affinity, their ranking was similar, and the correlation between the ec50 values was excellent (r(2) = 0.96), as was the correlation with their potency in a transactivation assay (r(2) = 0.94). moreover, when the erα-coregulator binding profiles were hierarchically clustered using euclidian cluster distance, the structurally related compounds were found to cluster together, whereas the steroid test compounds having an aromatic a-ring were separated from those with a cyclohexene a-ring. we concluded that this assay is capable of distinguishing erα agonists and antagonists and that it even reflects the structural similarity of erα agonists, indicating a potential to achieve identification and classification of erα endocrine disruptors with high fidelity.	@norel@
the role of rasagiline in the treatment of parkinson's disease. parkinson's disease (pd) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1% to 2% of people older than 60 years. treatment of pd consists of symptomatic therapies while neuroprotective strategies have remained elusive. rasagiline is a novel, potent, and irreversible monoamine oxidase type b (mao-b) inhibitor which has been approved for treatment of pd. rasagiline inhibits mao-b more potently than selegiline and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. in several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, rasagiline has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in early pd and as adjunctive therapy in advanced pd. in addition, rasagiline has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. the recently completed delayed-start adagio (attenuation of disease progression with azilect given once-daily) trial suggests a potential disease-modifying effect for rasagiline 1 mg/day, though the clinical import of this finding has yet to be established.	rasagiline @chemical@ monoamine oxidase type b @gene@ @cpr:4@ rasagiline @chemical@ mao-b @gene@ @cpr:4@ rasagiline @chemical@ mao-b @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors protect against mononuclear phagocyte neurotoxicity. neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are believed to be contributing factors to neurodegeneration in normal aging, as well as in age-related neurological disorders. reactive microglia are found in increased numbers in aging brain and are prominently associated with lesions in such age-related degenerative conditions as alzheimer's disease (ad), parkinson's disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). in vitro, stimulated microglia or microglial-like cells secrete neurotoxic materials and are generators of free radicals through their respiratory burst system. agents that suppress microglial activation are therefore candidates for neuroprotection. we have developed quantitative in vitro assays for measuring neurotoxicity of microglia or other mononuclear phagocytes. neuronal like sh-sy5y cells are cultured in supernatants from activated cells of the human monocytic thp-1 line and their survival is followed. respiratory burst is directly measured on the activated cells. we tested inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (cox) or the 5-lipoxygenase (5-lox) pathways as possible neuroprotective agents. the cox pathway generates inflammatory prostaglandins, while the 5-lox pathway generates inflammatory leukotrienes. we found that inhibitors of both these pathways suppressed neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. they included the cox-1 inhibitor indomethacin; the cox-2 inhibitor ns-398; the mixed cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor ibuprofen; the nitric oxide (no) derivatives of indomethacin, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen; the 5-lox inhibitor rev 5901; and the 5-lox activating protein (flap) inhibitor mk-886. the flap inhibitor also reduced respiratory burst activity in a more potent manner than indomethacin. combinations of cox and 5-lox inhibitors were more effective than single inhibitors. the data suggest that both cox inhibitors and 5-lox inhibitors may be neuroprotective in vivo by suppressing toxic actions of microglia/macrophages, and that combinations of the two might have greater therapeutic potential than single inhibitors of either class.	rev 5901 @chemical@ 5-lox @gene@ @cpr:4@ mk-886 @chemical@ 5-lox activating protein @gene@ @cpr:4@ mk-886 @chemical@ flap @gene@ @cpr:4@ ns-398 @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ibuprofen @chemical@ cox-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ibuprofen @chemical@ cox-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ prostaglandins @chemical@ cox @gene@ @cpr:9@ leukotrienes @chemical@ 5-lox @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
valproic acid selectively inhibits conversion of arachidonic acid to arachidonoyl-coa by brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetases: relevance to bipolar disorder. rationale: several drugs used to treat bipolar disorder (lithium and carbamazepine), when administered chronically to rats, reduce the turnover of arachidonic acid, but not docosahexaenoic acid, in brain phospholipids by decreasing the activity of an arachidonic acid-selective phospholipase a(2). although chronic valproic acid produces similar effects on brain arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid turnover, it does not alter phospholipase a(2) activity, suggesting that it targets a different enzyme in the turnover pathway. materials and methods/results: by isolating rat brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetases (acsl), we show in vitro that valproic acid is a non-competitive inhibitor of acsl, as it reduces the maximal velocity of the reaction without changing the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme. while valproic acid inhibited the synthesis of arachidonoyl-coa, palmitoyl-coa, and docosahexaenoyl-coa, the k (i )for inhibition of arachidonoyl-coa synthesis (14.1 mm) was approximately one fifth the k (i) for inhibiting palmitoyl-coa (85.4 mm) and docosahexaenoyl-coa (78.2 mm) synthesis. as chronic administration of valproic acid in bipolar disorder achieves whole-brain levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mm, inhibition of arachidonoyl-coa formation can occur at brain concentrations that are therapeutically relevant to this disease. furthermore, brain microsomal acsl did not produce valproyl-coa. conclusions: this study shows that valproic acid acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of brain microsomal acsl, and that inhibition is substrate-selective. the study supports the hypothesis that valproic acid acts in bipolar disorder by reducing the brain arachidonic acid cascade, by inhibiting arachidonoyl-coa formation.	lithium @chemical@ phospholipase a(2) @gene@ @cpr:4@ valproic acid @chemical@ acsl @gene@ @cpr:4@ carbamazepine @chemical@ phospholipase a(2) @gene@ @cpr:4@ valproic acid @chemical@ brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetases @gene@ @cpr:4@ valproic acid @chemical@ brain microsomal acsl @gene@ @cpr:4@ arachidonoyl-coa @chemical@ brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetases @gene@ @cpr:9@ arachidonic acid @chemical@ brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetases @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
cortisol and interferon tau regulation of endometrial function and conceptus development in female sheep. during early pregnancy in sheep, the elongating conceptus secretes interferon-τ (ifnt) and the conceptus as well as endometrial epithelia produce prostaglandins (pg) via pg synthase 2 (ptgs2) and cortisol via hydroxysteroid (11-β) dehydrogenase 1 (hsd11b1). ovarian progesterone induces and pg and ifnt stimulates endometrial hsd11b1 expression and keto-reductase activity as well as many epithelial genes that govern trophectoderm proliferation, migration, and attachment during elongation. the primary aim of these studies was to test the hypothesis that hsd11b1-derived cortisol has a biological role in endometrial function and conceptus development during early pregnancy in sheep. in study 1, cyclic ewes received vehicle, cortisol, pf 915275 (pf; a selective inhibitor of hsd11b1), cortisol and pf, meloxicam (a selective inhibitor of ptgs2), cortisol and meloxicam, recombinant ovine ifnt, or ifnt and pf into the uterus from day 10 to day14 after estrus. cortisol and ifnt stimulated endometrial hsd11b1 expression and activity, increased endometrial ptgs2 activity and the amount of pg in the uterine lumen, and up-regulated many conceptus elongation-related genes in the endometrium. some effects of cortisol and ifnt were mediated by ptgs2-derived pg. in study 2, bred ewes received pf 915275 or recombinant ovine ifnt and into the uterus from day 10 to day 14 after mating. inhibition of hsd11b1 activity in utero prevented conceptus elongation, whereas ifnt rescued conceptus elongation in pf-infused ewes. these results suggest that hsd11b1-derived cortisol mediates, in part, actions of ovarian progesterone and the conceptus on endometrial function and support the hypothesis that ifnt, pg, and cortisol coordinately regulate endometrial functions important for conceptus elongation and implantation during early pregnancy in sheep.	cortisol @chemical@ hsd11b1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cortisol @chemical@ ptgs2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cortisol @chemical@ hsd11b1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pf 915275 @chemical@ hsd11b1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ meloxicam @chemical@ ptgs2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ cortisol @chemical@ hsd11b1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ prostaglandins @chemical@ pg synthase 2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ prostaglandins @chemical@ ptgs2 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cortisol @chemical@ hsd11b1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cortisol @chemical@ hydroxysteroid (11-β) dehydrogenase 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cortisol @chemical@ hsd11b1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
decitabine--bedside to bench. purpose of the review: epigenetic changes marked by dna methylation are known to contribute to the malignant transformation of cells by silencing critical genes. decitabine inhibits dna methyltransferase and has shown therapeutic effects in patients with hematologic malignancies. however, the connection between the clinical activity of decitabine and its demethylating activity is not clear. herein, we summarize the results of recent clinical trials of decitabine in hematologic malignancies, and review the translational research into decitabine's mechanism of clinical activity. recent findings: low-dose decitabine has been studied recently in multiple clinical trials and has been shown to be effective for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. correlative laboratory studies of clinical trials have shown that decitabine induces global hypomethylation as well as hypomethylation of gene-specific promoters and activation of gene expression. past a given threshold, induction of higher degrees of hypomethylation is not directly associated with a better clinical outcome. moreover, studies have suggested that patients with promoter hypermethylation of p15(ink4b) at baseline have paradoxically a lower chance of achieving response than those without hypermethylation. furthermore, several other genes activated by decitabine were independent of hypomethylation in the promoter regions. conclusion: while at least part of decitabine's activity is through induction of hypomethylation and reactivation of critical genes, mechanisms independent from hypomethylation are also important for decitabine's antitumor activity.	decitabine @chemical@ dna methyltransferase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
effects of nedocromil sodium and web 2086 on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration through cellular and noncellular barriers. nedocromil sodium (tilade) is an effective therapeutic agent against asthma and has been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory activity in vitro; however, its mode of action is yet to be described fully. using an in vitro assay designed to mimic the extravasation of neutrophils from the peripheral circulation through cellular barriers to sites of inflammation, the effect of nedocromil sodium on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration was examined. we also examined the effects of web 2086, a platelet-activating factor (paf) receptor antagonist, in parallel. neutrophils and the cellular barrier were pretreated and/or co-incubated with nedocromil or web 2086 and the effects on neutrophil chemotaxis measured. in all treatments, nedocromil did not significantly affect chemotaxis through cellular or noncellular barriers to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp), leukotriene b4 (ltb4), or paf. in contrast, web 2086 inhibited paf-induced neutrophil migration through both naked filters and endothelial and epithelial monolayers cultured on these filters. we conclude that while nedocromil has been shown to have inhibitory effects on neutrophils and is an effective therapeutic agent for asthma and inflammatory conditions, its activity is not primarily mediated by inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. platelet-activating factor antagonists may partially be effective in asthma through inhibitory effects on neutrophil chemotaxis.	web 2086 @chemical@ platelet-activating factor (paf) receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
characterization of substituted phenylpropylamides as highly selective agonists at the melatonin mt2 receptor. melatonin is a widely distributed hormone that regulates several major physiological processes, including the circadian rhythm and seasonal adaptation. the two subtypes of mammalian g protein-coupled melatonin receptors are primarily responsible for mediating the actions of melatonin. because synthetic melatonin agonists have considerable therapeutic potentials in modulating insomnia and circadian- related sleep disorders, it is highly desirable to develop subtype-selective melatoninergic compounds. the pharmacological potencies of a series of substituted n-[3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propyl] amides towards human melatonin mt(1) and mt(2) receptors were evaluated by the flipr high-throughput screening assay, whilst their subtype-selectivity was subsequently verified with erk phosphorylation and camp assays. structure-activity relationship analysis of highly potent subtype-selective ligands (mt(2) ec(50) 10-90 pm) revealed that a benzyloxyl substituent incorporated at c6 position of the 3-methoxyphenyl ring dramatically enhanced the mt(2) potency and at the same time decreased mt(1) potency. incorporation of structural moieties conferring the subtype selectivity produced several extremely potent mt(2)-selective ligands. the most potent subtype-selective ligand, 2q had a substantially higher potency for mt(2) receptor than melatonin for elevation of [ca(2+)]i and inhibition of forskolin-elevated camp. representative mt(2)-selective ligands also induced erk phosphorylation in both recombinant and native cell lines, and no cross-reactivity to 17 other gpcrs could be detected. these ligands represent invaluable tools for delineating the functional roles of distinct melatonin receptor subtypes and are viable candidates for drug development.	phenylpropylamides @chemical@ melatonin mt2 receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ 
characterization of rat brain aldosterone receptors reveals high affinity for corticosterone. the two [3h]aldosterone-binding proteins of rat brain cytosol were characterized by a dextran-coated charcoal method. with molybdate present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for [3h]aldosterone in adrenalectomized perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nm at 4 c. high affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. a small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with corticosteroid-binding globulin (cbg) was found. however, due to the very high affinity of cbg for corticosterone at 4 c, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding sites. selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% (nh4)2so4 reduced cbg concentrations to negligible levels. after blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (ru 26988), the order of steroids in competing for the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone greater than fludrocortisone greater than corticosterone greater than aldosterone greater than progesterone greater than dexamethasone. readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar to that of the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone greater than desoxycorticosterone greater than corticosterone). the distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. the high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type ii receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. it is concluded that the high affinity aldosterone receptor of rat brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a mineralocorticoid receptor, may bind either corticosterone or aldosterone in vivo.

how may anticancer chemotherapy with fluorouracil be individualised? fluorouracil is used clinically against various solid tumours. both fluorouracil toxicity and pharmacokinetics vary highly within and between individuals. the reasons why doses are not individualised routinely are difficulties in defining, predicting and achieving an optimal fluorouracil exposure or dose because of a narrow therapeutic index, nonlinear pharmacokinetics, variabilities in administration rates and metabolism, and in targets like thymidylate synthase. to individualise fluorouracil administration before the first dose, assessment of the individual dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dpd) activity may be useful, because this genetically highly polymorphic enzyme controls approximately 80% of fluorouracil elimination. a complete or partial loss of dpd activity in 0.1 and 3-5% of caucasians, respectively, leads to increased fluorouracil exposure and toxicity. several methods to assess dpd activity in patients have been proposed (genotyping, various phenotyping methods), but each of them has limitations, as has the fluorouracil test dose approach. to adapt exposure towards fluorouracil a priori, a combination of genotyping and phenotyping may yield better prediction of toxicity than one method alone. a prerequisite for dose adaptation is the definition of fluorouracil exposure ranges with sufficient therapeutic activity, but without serious toxicity. while an increased risk of leukopenia, diarrhoea, stomatitis, and hand-foot syndrome during continuous 5-day infusions was related to fluorouracil exposures above an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) threshold of 25-30 mg.h/l, tumour response was higher when an auc of approximately 30 mg.h/l was achieved, illustrating the extremely narrow therapeutic window of fluorouracil. pharmacokinetic target values are less clear for other regimens, including chronomodulated regimens, which yielded a superior clinically efficacy and tolerability in several trials. however, the monitoring of fluorouracil plasma concentrations seems principally useful for individual a posteriori dose adjustment. whether an adaptation of the fluorouracil starting dose to the results of two dpd activity tests before fluorouracil administration a priori, and the adaptation of doses to fluorouracil exposure a posteriori is a reasonable approach to better prevent toxicity and increase efficacy, remains to be evaluated in randomised clinical studies comparing these strategies to routine clinical safety monitoring.	@norel@
salicylate pre-treatment attenuates intensity of bronchial and nasal symptoms precipitated by aspirin in aspirin-intolerant patients. aspirin (asa) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitors, precipitate asthmatic attacks in asa-intolerant patients, while sodium salicylate, hardly active on cox by itself, is well tolerated by these patients. however, salicylate moiety appears to interfere with aspirin inhibitory action on platelets and vascular cox. such interaction, if present at the level of respiratory tract, may be of interest to pathogenesis of asa-induced asthma. we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study on the effect of choline magnesium trisalicylate (cmt, trilisate) pre-treatment on asa-induced adverse reactions in nine patients. pulmonary function tests, nasal symptoms score, pnif and serum salicylate levels were monitored following challenges with threshold doses of asa. trilisate administered at a dose of 3000 mg daily for 3 days, offered a moderate protection against asa-induced symptoms; it diminished the severity and/or delayed the appearance of fev1 fall. maximal decreases in fev1 as well as reaction intensity indexes were significantly lower (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.002, respectively) after trilisate pre-treatment as compared to placebo. trilisate also attenuated nasal symptoms in three out of five patients. although the precise mechanism of the protective action of trilisate is unknown, our data support the possibility of interaction between salicylate and asa on cyclo-oxygenase locus in the respiratory tract in asa-intolerant patients.	aspirin @chemical@ cox @gene@ @cpr:4@ aspirin @chemical@ cyclooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ aspirin @chemical@ cox @gene@ @cpr:4@ asa @chemical@ cyclooxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ asa @chemical@ cox @gene@ @cpr:4@ salicylate @chemical@ cyclo-oxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ asa @chemical@ cyclo-oxygenase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
cytochrome p450-mediated herb-drug interaction potential of galgeun-tang. we evaluated the herb-drug interaction potential of galgeun-tang (ggt) extracts, mediated by cytochrome p450 (cyp) inhibition/induction. further, the effects of fermentation on the cyp-mediated herb-drug interaction potential of ggt extracts were determined. as measured by lc-esi/ms/ms, ggt extracts (0-300μg/ml) showed no inhibitory activity toward eight cyp isoforms (1a2, 2a6, 2b6, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6, 2e1, and 3a4) in pooled human liver microsomes, suggesting that ggt may have low potential for herb-drug interactions mediated by cyp inhibition. hepatic cyp expression and activity in rats treated with ggt extracts twice per day for 1week was examined. among the tested cyp isoforms (1a1, 1a2, 1b1, 2b1, 2c11, 2e1, 3a1, 3a2, and 4a1), cyp1b1 and 4a1 were increased by ggt extracts. hepatic activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase, 7-pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase, but not midazolam hydroxylase were also elevated. these results raise the possibility that ggt extracts may increase the toxicity of environmental toxicants through the elevating cyp-dependent metabolic activation. interestingly, the increases in cyp1b1 and cyp4a1 levels, and 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase, 7-pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase activities were attenuated by fermentation of ggt extract using lactobacillus plantarum kfri 402, but not 144. further studies are needed to identify the cyp regulatory component(s) from ggt and determination its metabolism.	@norel@
cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo. cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized n-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria rapidly. in addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. it has good affinity for pbps 2 and 3 of escherichia coli and for pbp 3 of pseudomonas aeruginosa. its broad-spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. it is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against enterobacteriaceae. the mic90 for p. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. other gram-negative organisms, haemophilus influenzae, neiserria meningitidis, neiserria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. among gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae. only strains of p. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. in experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.	@norel@
abnormally high plasma levels of vitamin b6 in children with autism not taking supplements compared to controls not taking supplements. background: there have been many studies of the effect of high-dose supplementation of vitamin b6 on children and adults with autism, with all but one reporting benefits. objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical basis for vitamin b6 therapy by measuring the level of total vitamin b6 in the plasma of unsupplemented children with autism spectrum disorder compared to unsupplemented control subjects. participants: children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 35, age 3-9 years) and unrelated typical children (n = 11, age 6-9 years), all from arizona, were studied. (this includes the data from 24 children with autism from our previous study.) methodology: a microbiologic assay was used to measure the level of total vitamin b6 (including phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms), in a blinded fashion. results: children with autism had a 75% higher level of total vitamin b6 than the controls (medians of 56 versus 32 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.00002). most of the autistic children (77%) had levels that were more than 2 standard deviations above the median value of the controls. the autistic girls (n = 5) also had elevated levels (mean of 54.6 ng/ml, median of 60 ng/ml). discussion: these results are consistent with previous studies that found that: (1) pyridoxal kinase had a very low activity in children with autism and (2) pyridoxal 5 phosphate (plp) levels are unusually low in children with autism. thus, it appears that the low conversion of pyridoxal and pyridoxine to plp results in low levels of plp, which is the active cofactor for 113 known enzymatic reactions, including the formation of many key neurotransmitters. conclusions: total vitamin b6 is abnormally high in autism, consistent with previous reports of an impaired pyridoxal kinase for the conversion of pyridoxine and pyridoxal to plp. this may explain the many published studies of benefits of high-dose vitamin b6 supplementation in some children and adults with autism.	plp @chemical@ pyridoxal kinase @gene@ @cpr:9@ pyridoxine @chemical@ pyridoxal kinase @gene@ @cpr:9@ pyridoxal @chemical@ pyridoxal kinase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-(5-thioxo-5h-[1,2]dithiol-3yl)-phenyl ester (atb-429), a hydrogen sulfide-releasing derivative of mesalamine, exerts antinociceptive effects in a model of postinflammatory hypersensitivity. h(2)s functions as a neuromodulator and exerts anti-inflammatory activities. recent data indicate that irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is linked to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. in this study, we have investigated the role of a novel h(2)s-releasing derivative of mesalamine (5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-(5-thioxo-5h-[1,2]dithiol-3yl)-phenyl ester, atb-429) in modulating nociception to colorectal distension (crd), a model that mimics some features of ibs, in healthy and postcolitic rats. four graded (0.4-1.6 ml of water) crds were produced in conscious rats, and colorectal sensitivity and pain were assessed by measuring the abdominal withdrawal response and spinal c-fos expression. in healthy rats, atb-429 dose dependently (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) attenuated crd-induced hypersensitivity and significantly inhibited crd-induced overexpression of spinal c-fos mrna, whereas mesalamine had no effect. atb-429-induced antinociception was reversed by glibenclamide, a atp-sensitive k(+) (k(atp)) channel inhibitor. the antinociceptive effect of atb-429 was maintained in a rodent model of postinflammatory hypersensitivity (4 weeks after colitis induction). at a dose of 100 mg/kg, atb-429 reversed the allodynic response caused by crd in postcolitic rats. colonic cyclooxygenase-2 and interkeukin-1beta mrna and spinal c-fos mrna expression were significantly down-regulated by atb-429, but not by mesalamine. atb-429, but not mesalamine, increased blood concentrations of h(2)s in both healthy and postcolitic rats. taken together, these data suggest that atb-429 inhibits hypersensitivity induced by crd in both healthy and postcolitic, allodynic rats by a k(atp) channel-mediated mechanism. this study provides evidence that h(2)s-releasing drugs might have beneficial effects in the treatment of painful intestinal disorders.	atb-429 @chemical@ c-fos @gene@ @cpr:4@ atb-429 @chemical@ cyclooxygenase-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ atb-429 @chemical@ interkeukin-1beta @gene@ @cpr:4@ atb-429 @chemical@ c-fos @gene@ @cpr:4@ glibenclamide @chemical@ atp-sensitive k(+) (k(atp)) channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
steroidal glycosides from the bulbs of fritillaria meleagris and their cytotoxic activities. steroidal glycosides (1-18), including 10 new compounds (1-10), were isolated from the bulbs of fritillaria meleagris (liliaceae). the structures of the new compounds were determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr analysis, and by hydrolytic cleavage followed by spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis. the isolated compounds and their aglycones were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against hl-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and a549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. morphological observation and flow cytometry analysis showed that 5β-spirostanol glycoside (2) and a cholestane derivative (17a) induced apoptotic cell death in hl-60 cells through different mechanisms of action. furthermore, the (22r)-spirosolanol glycoside (11) selectively induced apoptosis in a549 cells without affecting the caspase-3 activity level.	@norel@
effects of ozone and fine particulate matter (pm(2.5)) on rat system inflammation and cardiac function. in order to understand the toxic mechanisms of cardiovascular system injuries induced by ambient pm(2.5) and/or ozone, a subacute toxicological animal experiment was designed with exposure twice a week for 3 continuous weeks. wistar rats were randomly categorized into 8 groups (n=6): 1 control group, 3 groups exposed to fine particulate matters (pm(2.5)) alone at 3 doses (0.2, 0.8, or 3.2 mg/rat), 1 group to ozone (0.81 ppm) alone and 3 groups to ozone plus pm(2.5) at 3 doses (0.2, 0.8, or 3.2 mg/rat). heart rate (hr) and electrocardiogram (ecg) was monitored at approximately 24-h both after the 3rd exposure and the last (6th) exposure, and systolic blood pressure (sbp) was monitored at approximately 24-h after the 6th exposure. biomarkers of systemic inflammation and injuries (crp, il-6, ldh, ck), heart oxidative stress (mda, sod) and endothelial function (et-1, vegf) were analyzed after the 6th exposure. additionally, myocardial ultrastructural alterations were observed under transmission electron microscopy (tem) for histopathological analyses. results showed that pm(2.5) alone exposure could trigger the significant increase of crp, mda, ck, et-1 and sbp and decrease of heart rate variability (hrv), a marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ans) function. ozone alone exposure in rats did not show significant alterations in any indicators. ozone plus pm(2.5) exposure, however, induced crp, il-6, ck, ldh and mda increase, sod and hrv decrease significantly in a dose-response way. meanwhile, abnormal ecg types were monitored in rats exposed to pm(2.5) with and without ozone and obvious myocardial ultrastructural changes were observed by tem. in conclusion, pm(2.5) alone exposure could cause inflammation, endothelial function and ans injuries, and ozone potentiated these effects induced by pm(2.5).	ozone @chemical@ crp @gene@ @cpr:3@ ozone @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:3@ ozone @chemical@ ck @gene@ @cpr:3@ ozone @chemical@ ldh @gene@ @cpr:3@ ozone @chemical@ sod @gene@ @cpr:4@

transcriptional regulation of human ferredoxin 1 in ovarian granulosa cells. ferredoxin 1 (fdx1; adrenodoxin) is an iron-sulfur protein that is involved in various metabolic processes, including steroid hormone synthesis in mammalian tissues. we investigated the transcriptional regulation of fdx1 in ovarian granulosa cells. previously, we reported that the nr5a family, including steroidogenic factor-1 (sf-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 could induce differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) into steroidogenic cells. a chip assay showed that sf-1 could bind to the fdx1 promoter in differentiated hmscs. luciferase reporter assays showed that transcription of fdx1 was synergistically activated by the nr5a family and 8br-camp treatment through two sf-1 binding sites and a cre-like sequence in a human ovarian granulosa cell line, kgn. knockdown of fdx1 attenuated progesterone production in kgn cells. these results indicate transcription of fdx1 is regulated by the nr5a family and camp signaling, and participates in steroid hormone production in ovarian granulosa cells.	8br-camp @chemical@ fdx1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ camp @chemical@ fdx1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ steroid @chemical@ fdx1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ steroid @chemical@ adrenodoxin @gene@ @cpr:9@ steroid @chemical@ ferredoxin 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ steroid hormone @chemical@ fdx1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ steroid hormone @chemical@ adrenodoxin @gene@ @cpr:9@ steroid hormone @chemical@ ferredoxin 1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ steroid @chemical@ fdx1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
selective inhibitors and tailored activity probes for lipoprotein-associated phospholipase a(2). lipoprotein-associated phospholipase a(2) (lp-pla(2) or pla(2)g7) binds to low-density lipoprotein (ldl) particles, where it is thought to hydrolyze oxidatively truncated phospholipids. lp-pla(2) has also been implicated as a pro-tumorigenic enzyme in human prostate cancer. several inhibitors of lp-pla(2) have been described, including darapladib, which is currently in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of atherosclerosis. the selectivity that darapladib and other lp-pla(2) inhibitors display across the larger serine hydrolase family has not, however, been reported. here, we describe the use of both general and tailored activity-based probes for profiling lp-pla(2) and inhibitors of this enzyme in native biological systems. we show that both darapladib and a novel class of structurally distinct carbamate inhibitors inactivate lp-pla(2) in mouse tissues and human cell lines with high selectivity. our findings thus identify both inhibitors and chemoproteomic probes that are suitable for investigating lp-pla(2) function in biological systems.	darapladib @chemical@ lp-pla(2) @gene@ @cpr:4@ darapladib @chemical@ lp-pla(2) @gene@ @cpr:4@ carbamate @chemical@ lp-pla(2) @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from hedyotis diffusa willd induces apoptosis in human leukemic u937 cells through modulation of mapk pathways. the herb of hedyotis diffusa willd (h. diffusa willd), an annual herb distributed in northeastern asia, has been known as a traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of cancer. recently, chinese researchers have discovered that two anthraquinones isolated from a water extract of h. diffusa willd showed apoptosis-inducing effects against cancer cells. however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. the current study determines the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) in human leukemic u937 cells apoptosis induced by 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from h. diffusa. our results showed that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone decreased phosphorylation-erk1/2 (p-erk1/2), and increased p-p38mapk, but did not affect expressions of p-jnk1/2 in u937 cells. moreover, treatment of u937 cells with 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone resulted in activation of caspase-3. furthermore, pd98059 (erk1/2 inhibitor) significantly enhanced 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone-induced apoptosis in u937 cells, whereas caspase-3 inhibitor or sb203580 (p-p38mapk inhibitor), decreased apoptosis in u937 cells. taken together, our study for the first time suggests that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone is able to enhance apoptosis of u937 cells, at least in part, through activation of p-p38mapk and downregulation of p-erk1/2. moreover, the triggering of caspase-3 activation mediated apoptotic induction.	2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone @chemical@ p-p38mapk @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone @chemical@ p-p38mapk @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone @chemical@ caspase-3 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sb203580 @chemical@ p-p38mapk @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the inhibitory effect of ginseng saponins on the stress-induced plasma interleukin-6 level in mice. the effect of ginseng saponins on plasma interleukin-6 (il-6) in non-stressed and immobilization-stressed mice were investigated. ginseng total saponins, ginsenosides rb2, rg1 and rd administered intraperitoneally attenuated the immobilization stress-induced increase in plasma il-6 level. but, intracerebroventricular injection of each ginsenoside did not affect plasma il-6 level induced by immobilization stress. ginsenosides rb2, rd and rg1 significantly decreased norepinephrine and/or epinephrine-induced increase of il-6 level in macrophage cell line (raw 264.7). thus, it can be suggested that the inhibitory action of ginseng saponins against the immobilization stress-induced increase of plasma il-6 level would be in periphery; at least in part, mediated by blocking norepinephrine- and/or epinephrine-induced increase of il-6 level in macrophage rather than in the brain. ginseng saponins might be proposed as a possible candidate in the research or therapeutic modulation of stress-related disorders.	epinephrine @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:3@ norepinephrine @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:3@ epinephrine @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:3@ norepinephrine @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:3@ ginseng saponins @chemical@ interleukin-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ saponins @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ginsenosides rb2, rg1 and rd @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ginsenosides rb2, rd and rg1 @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ginseng saponins @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ ginseng saponins @chemical@ il-6 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
treatment of niemann-pick disease type c in two children with miglustat: initial responses and maintenance of effects over 1 year. niemann-pick disease type c (np-c) is a lipid storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in the lysosomal/late endosomal system of certain cells in the central nervous system (cns) and visceral organs. clinical symptoms include progressive neurological deterioration and visceral organomegaly. miglustat, a small iminosugar molecule approved for the treatment of gaucher disease, reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyses the first committed step in glycosphingolipid synthesis. the physicochemical properties of miglustat allow it to cross the blood-brain barrier and suggest possible benefits in lysosomal storage diseases affecting the cns. here, we present findings in two children with np-c, aged 14 years (patient 1) and 9 years (patient 2), treated with miglustat for 1 year. before treatment, patient 1 presented with severe difficulties in swallowing and walking, and patient 2 with problems mostly affecting communication and social interaction. videofluoroscopic studies in patient 1 demonstrated a substantial improvement in swallowing by month 6 of treatment, and ambulation index measurements indicated improved walking. mini mental-state examination (mmse) assessments in patient 2 showed cognitive improvement by month 6, which was sustained up to month 12. liver/spleen volume and plasma chitotriosidase activities were stabilized in both cases. there was no weight loss during treatment. patient 1 experienced severe but self-limiting paresthesia, which was not associated with peripheral neuropathy. we conclude that miglustat can provide therapeutic benefits in cns symptoms and allows stabilization of systemic disease in childhood-onset np-c. further follow-up is crucial to determine the long-term maintenance of these effects.	miglustat @chemical@ glucosylceramide synthase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
two novel mutations in the men1 gene in subjects with multiple endocrine neoplasia-1. multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (men1) is characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic endocrine and pituitary adenomas as well as germline mutation of the men1 gene. we describe 2 families with men1 with novel mutations in the men1 gene. one family was of turkish origin, and the index patient had primary hyperparathyroidism (phpt) plus a prolactinoma; three relatives had phpt only. the index patient in the second family was a 46-yr-old woman of chinese origin living in taiwan. this patient presented with a complaint of epigastric pain and watery diarrhea over the past 3 months, and had undergone subtotal parathyroidectomy and enucleation of pancreatic islet cell tumor about 10 yr before. there was also a prolactinoma. sequence analysis of the men1 gene from leukocyte genomic dna revealed heterozygous mutations in both probands. the turkish patient and her affected relatives all had a heterozygous a to g transition at codon 557 (aag-->gag) of exon 10 of men1 that results in a replacement of lysine by glutamic acid. the chinese index patient and one of her siblings had a heterozygous mutation at codon 418 of exon 9 (gac-->tat) that results in a substitution of aspartic acid by tyrosine. in conclusion, we have identified 2 novel missense mutations in the men1 gene.	@norel@
artemisinic acid inhibits melanogenesis through downregulation of c/ebp α-dependent expression of hmg-coa reductase gene. cholesterol is associated with the regulation of melanogenesis which is the major physiological defense against solar irradiation. the present study was designed to determine the effects of artemisinic acid on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes. in this study, we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content. the mrna levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) and its downstream genes tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (trp)-1, and trp-2 were reduced by artemisinic acid treatment. additionally, the mrna levels of melanogenesis-related genes (c-kit, stem cell factor (scf), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif)) were down-regulated by artemisinic acid. furthermore, camp production and protein kinase a (pka) activity were suppressed by artemisinic acid. moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid-mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coa (hmg coa) reductase gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the ccaat/enhancer-binding protein (c/ebp) α gene. taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by artemisinic acid occurs through reduced expression of the hmg coa reductase gene, which is mediated by c/ebp α inhibition and suggest that artemisinic acid may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.	artemisinic acid @chemical@ microphthalmia-associated transcription factor @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ mitf @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ tyrosinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ tyrosinase-related protein (trp)-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ trp-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ c-kit @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ stem cell factor @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ scf @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ macrophage migration inhibitory factor @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ mif @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ hydroxymethylglutaryl coa (hmg coa) reductase @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ ccaat/enhancer-binding protein (c/ebp) α @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ hmg-coa reductase @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ hmg coa reductase @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ protein kinase a @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ pka @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ c/ebp α @gene@ @cpr:4@ artemisinic acid @chemical@ c/ebp α @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
protective effects of selenium on oxidative damage and oxidative stress related gene expression in rat liver under chronic poisoning of arsenic. arsenic (as) is a toxic metalloid existing widely in the environment, and chronic exposure to it through contaminated drinking water has become a global problem of public health. the present study focused on the protective effects of selenium on oxidative damage of chronic arsenic poisoning in rat liver. rats were divided into four groups at random and given designed treatments for 20weeks. the oxidative damage of liver tissue was evaluated by lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes. oxidative stress related genes were detected to reflect the liver stress state at the molecular level. compared to the control and na2seo3 groups, the mda content in liver tissue was decreased and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased in the na2seo3 intervention group. the mrna levels of sod1, cat, gpx and txnrd1 were increased significantly (p<0.05) in the combined na2seo3+naaso2 treatment group. the expressions of hsp70 and ho-1 were significantly (p<0.05) increased in the naaso2 group and reduced in the combined treatment group. the results indicate that long-term intake of naaso2 causes oxidative damage in the rat liver, and na2seo3 protects liver cells by adjusting the expression of oxidative stress related genes to improve the activities of antioxidant enzymes.	naaso2 @chemical@ hsp70 @gene@ @cpr:3@ naaso2 @chemical@ ho-1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ na2seo3 @chemical@ sod1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ na2seo3 @chemical@ cat @gene@ @cpr:3@ na2seo3 @chemical@ gpx @gene@ @cpr:3@ naaso2 @chemical@ sod1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ naaso2 @chemical@ cat @gene@ @cpr:4@ naaso2 @chemical@ gpx @gene@ @cpr:4@ naaso2 @chemical@ txnrd1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ na2seo3 @chemical@ txnrd1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
energy depletion of bovine mammary epithelial cells activates ampk and suppresses protein synthesis through inhibition of mtorc1 signaling. the molecular mechanisms by which cellular energy status regulates global protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells have not been characterized. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) activation by 2-deoxyglucose on protein synthesis and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) signaling pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells. phosphorylation of ampk at thr172 increased by 1.4-fold within 5 min, and remained elevated throughout a 30-min time course, in response to 2-deoxyglucose. global rates of protein synthesis declined by 78% of control values. the decline in protein synthesis was associated with repression of mtorc1 signaling, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s6 kinase 1 and eif4e binding protein-1 (4e-bp1). phosphorylation of er-stress marker eif2α was also increased but only at 30 min of 2-deoxyglucose exposure. 2-deoxyglucose increased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (tsc2) on ampk consensus sites but did not change the amount of tsc1 bound to tsc2. activation of ampk did not result in changes in the amount of raptor bound to mtor. the inhibitory effects of ampk activation on mtorc1 signaling were associated with a marked increase in ser792 phosphorylation on raptor. collectively, the results suggest that activation of ampk represses global protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells through inhibition of mtorc1 signaling.	2-deoxyglucose @chemical@ ampk @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2-deoxyglucose @chemical@ eif2α @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2-deoxyglucose @chemical@ tsc2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2-deoxyglucose @chemical@ tuberous sclerosis complex 2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2-deoxyglucose @chemical@ tsc2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2-deoxyglucose @chemical@ ampk @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
neuroprotection by estrogen against mpp+-induced dopamine neuron death is mediated by eralpha in primary cultures of mouse mesencephalon. estrogen involvement in neuroprotection is now widely accepted, although the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of estrogen action in neuroprotection remain unclear. this study examines estrogenic effects in a mixed population of cells in attempts to identify the contributing cells that result in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. utilizing primary mesencephalic neurons, we found expression of both estrogen receptor alpha (eralpha) and estrogen receptor beta (erbeta) with a predominance of eralpha on both dopamine neurons and astrocytes. we also found that 17beta-estradiol protects dopamine neurons from injury induced by the complex i inhibitor, 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (mpp(+)) in a time- and er-dependent manner. at least 4 h of estrogen pre-treatment was required to elicit protection, an effect that was blocked by the er antagonist, ici 182,780. moreover, eralpha mediated the protection afforded by estrogen since only the eralpha agonist, hpte, but not the erbeta agonist, dpn, protected against dopamine cell loss. since glial cells were shown to express significant levels of eralpha, we investigated a possible indirect mechanism of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection through glial cell interaction. removal of glial cells from the cultures by application of the mitotic inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, significantly reduced the neuroprotective effects of estrogen. these data indicate that neuroprotection provided by estrogen against mpp(+) toxicity is mediated by eralpha and involves an interplay among at least two cell types.	dpn @chemical@ erbeta @gene@ @cpr:5@ ici 182,780 @chemical@ er @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
molecular pharmacology of human cav3.2 t-type ca2+ channels: block by antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, and their analogs. antihypertensive drugs of the "calcium channel blocker" or "calcium antagonist" class have been used to establish the physiological role of l-type ca(2+) channels in vascular smooth muscle. in contrast, there has been limited progress on the pharmacology t-type ca(2+) channels. t-type channels play a role in cardiac pacemaking, aldosterone secretion, and renal hemodynamics, leading to the hypothesis that mixed t- and l-type blockers may have therapeutic advantages over selective l-type blockers. the goal of this study was to identify compounds that block the ca(v)3.2 t-type channel with high affinity, focusing on two classes of compounds: phenylalkylamines (e.g., mibefradil) and dihydropyridines (e.g., efonidipine). compounds were tested using a validated ca(2+) influx assay into a cell line expressing recombinant ca(v)3.2 channels. this study identified four clinically approved antihypertensive drugs (efonidipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nitrendipine) as potent t-channel blockers (ic(50) < 3 microm). in contrast, other widely prescribed dihydropyridines, such as amlodipine and nifedipine, were 10-fold less potent, making them a more appropriate choice in research studies on the role of l-type currents. in summary, the present results support the notion that many available antihypertensive drugs block a substantial fraction of t-current at therapeutically relevant concentrations, contributing to their mechanism of action.	efonidipine @chemical@ t-channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ felodipine @chemical@ t-channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ isradipine @chemical@ t-channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ nitrendipine @chemical@ t-channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
mechanisms of lipid-lowering agents. lipid-lowering agents are used with the purpose of ameliorating hyperlipoproteinemias, in order to prevent arterial disease. lipid-lowering drugs can be classified into absorbable agents and into nonabsorbable compounds, acting within the gastrointestinal lumen. absorbable drugs (fibric acids, nicotinic acid, probucol, hmg-coa reductase inhibitors) reduce plasma very-low-density lipoproteins (vldl) and/or low-density lipoproteins (ldl) by a variety of mechanisms. fibric acids, in particular, act by stimulating the catabolism of vldl and also, as a consequence, improving ldl delipidation, thus favoring receptor uptake. nicotinic acid and acipimox interfere with the biosynthesis of ldl and can also improve the clearance of vldl/ldl. probucol acts by a newly described mechanism, i.e. accelerating reverse transport of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins to lower-density lipoproteins. finally, hmg-coa reductase inhibitors, interfering with the biosynthesis of cholesterol, can induce an increased expression of liver high-affinity lipoprotein receptors. nonabsorbable agents (anion-exchange resins, neomycin, beta-sitosterol) interrupt the recirculation of bile acids and/or reduce the absorption of cholesterol with the gut. they display a selective activity on hypercholesterolemia, again by increasing ldl receptor expression. the choice of one or more lipid-lowering agents will depend upon the patient's phenotype, determining responsiveness to the pharmacological treatment.	fibric acids @chemical@ plasma very-low-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:4@ fibric acids @chemical@ vldl @gene@ @cpr:4@ fibric acids @chemical@ low-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:4@ fibric acids @chemical@ ldl @gene@ @cpr:4@ nicotinic acid @chemical@ plasma very-low-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:4@ nicotinic acid @chemical@ vldl @gene@ @cpr:4@ nicotinic acid @chemical@ low-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:4@ nicotinic acid @chemical@ ldl @gene@ @cpr:4@ probucol @chemical@ plasma very-low-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:4@ probucol @chemical@ vldl @gene@ @cpr:4@ probucol @chemical@ low-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:4@ probucol @chemical@ ldl @gene@ @cpr:4@ fibric acids @chemical@ vldl @gene@ @cpr:4@ cholesteryl esters @chemical@ high-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesteryl esters @chemical@ lower-density lipoproteins @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
safrole-2',3'-oxide induces atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability in apolipoprotein e-knockout mice. safrole-2',3'-oxide (sfo) is the major electrophilic metabolite of safrole (4-allyl-1, 2-methylenedioxybenzene), a natural plant constituent found in essential oils of numerous edible herbs and spices and in food containing these herbs, such as pesto sauce, cola beverages and bologna sausages. the effects of sfo in mammalian systems, especially the cardiovascular system, are little known. disruption of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques in atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is the main cause of cardiovascular events. in this study, we investigated sfo-induced atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability (possibility of rupture) in apolipoprotein e-knockout (apoe(-/-)) mice. lipid area in vessel wall reached 59.8% in high dose sfo (sfo-hd) treated group, which is only 31.2% in control group. sfo treatment changed the lesion composition to an unstable phenotype, increased the number of apoptotic cells in plaque and the endothelium in plaques was damaged after sfo treatment. furthermore, compared with control groups, the plaque endothelium level of p75(ntr) was 3-fold increased and the liver level of p75(ntr) was 17.4-fold increased by sfo-hd. meanwhile, the serum level of kc (a functional homolog of il-8 and the main proinflammatory alpha chemokine in mice) in apoe(-/-) mice was up to 357pg/ml in sfo-hd treated group. thus, sfo contributes to the instability of atherosclerotic plaque in apoe(-/-) mice through activating p75(ntr) and il-8 and cell apoptosis in plaque.	sfo @chemical@ p75(ntr) @gene@ @cpr:3@ sfo @chemical@ il-8 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sfo @chemical@ p75(ntr) @gene@ @cpr:3@ sfo @chemical@ p75(ntr) @gene@ @cpr:3@ sfo @chemical@ il-8 @gene@ @cpr:3@ sfo @chemical@ alpha chemokine @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
deduced amino acid sequence from the bovine oxytocin-neurophysin i precursor cdna. the nonapeptide hormone oxytocin-like arginine-vasopressin (avp) is synthesized as part of a larger precursor polypeptide. the precursor also includes the neurophysin molecule with which the hormone is associated in the neurosecretory granules of the hypothalamo-pituitary tract. a protein of molecular weight (mr) approximately 20,000 has been isolated from supraoptic nuclei of rat hypothalami which, after tryptic cleavage, released a neurophysin-like molecule of mr approximately 10,000 and an oligopeptide related to oxytocin. this result was complemented by in vitro translation of bovine hypothalamic mrna. among the primary translation products a single polypeptide of mr approximately 16,500 was shown to contain antigenic determinants recognized by specific antisera against bovine neurophysin i and oxytocin. here we report the amino acid sequence of the bovine oxytocin-neurophysin i (ot-npi) precursor which was derived from sequence analysis of the cloned cdna. as is the case for the bovine arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin ii (avp-npii) precursor, the signal sequence of the ot-npi precursor is immediately followed by the nonapeptide hormone which is connected to neurophysin i by a gly-lys-arg sequence. a striking feature of the nucleic acid sequence is the 197-nucleotide long perfect homology with the avp-npii precursor mrna sequence encoding the conserved middle part of neurophysins i and ii.	@norel@
functional and bioenergetic consequences of at1 antagonist olmesartan medoxomil in hearts with postinfarction lv remodeling. the structural left ventricular (lv) remodeling and contractile dysfunction of hearts with postinfarction lv remodeling are benefited by angiotensin ii type 1 receptor (at1) blocker. however, the myocardial bioenergetic consequences of at1 blocker in these hearts are not known. to investigate, we used a porcine model of postinfarction lv remodeling produced by ligation of the left circumflex coronary artery. after infarction, 7 pigs received olmesartan medoxomil (2 mg/kg) for comparison against 9 untreated and 10 normal pigs. measurements of hemodynamics, myocardial perfusion, and myocardial bioenergetics were taken 7 weeks postinfarction. the treated group had an lv-to-body weight ratio significantly lower than the untreated group (2.69 +/- 0.70, 2.96 +/- 0.51, 3.66 +/- 0.60 g/kg for control, treated, and untreated groups, respectively). the untreated group had a mean aortic pressure significantly higher than the control (73 +/- 16, 86 +/- 14, and 94 +/- 20 mm hg, respectively). the subendocardial phosphocreatine-to-atp ratios of the treated group were significantly higher than that of the untreated group. the untreated group, but not the treated group, had significant reductions in mitochondrial f0f1-atpase subunits compared with controls. congestive heart failure as evidenced by significant ascites (100 to 2000 ml) developed in 4 of the 9 untreated animals, but was absent in the treated group. animals with heart failure demonstrated reductions in both mitochondrial f0f1-atpase expression and myocardial high-energy phosphate levels. thus, severe lv dysfunction and accompanying abnormal myocardial bioenergetic phenotype were prevented by the at1 antagonist olmesartan medoxomil.	olmesartan medoxomil @chemical@ at1 @gene@ @cpr:6@ olmesartan medoxomil @chemical@ at1 @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
cross-inhibition of sr-bi- and abca1-mediated cholesterol transport by the small molecules blt-4 and glyburide. scavenger receptor class b type i (sr-bi) and abca1 are structurally dissimilar cell surface proteins that play key roles in hdl metabolism. sr-bi is a receptor that binds hdl with high affinity and mediates both the selective lipid uptake of cholesteryl esters from lipid-rich hdl to cells and the efflux of unesterified cholesterol from cells to hdl. abca1 mediates the efflux of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipid-poor apolipoprotein a-i (apoa-i). the activities of abca1 and other atp binding cassette superfamily members are inhibited by the drug glyburide, and sr-bi-mediated lipid transport is blocked by small molecule inhibitors called blts. here, we show that one blt, [1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-3-naphthalen-2-yl-urea] (blt-4), blocked abca1-mediated cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apoa-i at a potency similar to that for its inhibition of sr-bi (ic(50) approximately 55-60 microm). reciprocally, glyburide blocked sr-bi-mediated selective lipid uptake and efflux at a potency similar to that for its inhibition of abca1 (ic(50) approximately 275-300 microm). as is the case with blts, glyburide increased the apparent affinity of hdl binding to sr-bi. the reciprocal inhibition of sr-bi and abca1 by blt-4 and glyburide raises the possibility that these proteins may share similar or common steps in their mechanisms of lipid transport.	blt-4 @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ blt-4 @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ glyburide @chemical@ atp binding cassette superfamily @gene@ @cpr:4@ blt @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ blt @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:4@ 1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-3-naphthalen-2-yl-urea @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-3-naphthalen-2-yl-urea @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:4@ cholesterol @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesteryl esters @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ sr-bi @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ abca1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
in vitro polyphenolics erythrocyte model and in vivo chicken embryo model revealed gallic acid to be a potential hemorrhage inducer: physicochemical action mechanisms. the in vivo chicken embryo model (cem) demonstrated that gallic acid (ga) induced dysvascularization and hypoxia. inflammatory edema, zenker's necrosis, hemolysis, and liposis of cervical muscles were the common symptoms. levels of the gene hif-1α, hif-1α, tnf-α, il-6, and nfκb in cervical muscles were all significantly upregulated, while the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) was downregulated in a dose-responsive manner. consequently, the cervical muscle inflammation and hemolysis could have been stimulated en route to the tissue tnf-α-canonical and the atypical pathways. we hypothesized that ga could deplete the dissolved oxygen (do) at the expense of semiquinone and quinone formation, favoring the reactive oxygen species (ros) production to induce rbc disruption and fe(2+) ion release. to explore this, the in vitro polyphenolics-erythrocyte model (pem) was established. pem revealed that the do was rapidly depleted, leading to the release of a huge amount of fe (ii) ions and hydrogen peroxide (hpo) in a two-phase kinetic pattern. the kinetic coefficients for fe (ii) ion release ranged from 0.347 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1); and those for fe (iii) ion production were from 6.66 × 10(-3) h(-1) to 8.93 × 10(-3) h(-1). for phase i hpo production, they ranged from 0.236 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1) and for phase ii hpo production from 0.764 h(-1) to 2.560 h(-1) at ga within 6 μm to 14 μm. thus, evidence obtained from pem could strongly support the phenomena of cem. to conclude, ga tends to elicit hypoxia-related inflammation and hemolysis in chicken cervical muscles through its extremely high prooxidant activity.	@norel@
differentiation of opioid drug effects by hierarchical multi-site phosphorylation. differences in the ability of opioid drugs to promote regulated endocytosis of μ-opioid receptors are related to their tendency to produce drug tolerance and dependence. here we show that drug-specific differences in receptor internalization are determined by a conserved, 10-residue sequence in the receptor's carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. diverse opioids induce receptor phosphorylation at serine (s)375, present in the middle of this sequence, but opioids differ markedly in their ability to drive higher-order phosphorylation on flanking residues [threonine (t)370, t376, and t379]. multi-phosphorylation is required for the endocytosis-promoting activity of this sequence and occurs both sequentially and hierarchically, with s375 representing the initiating site. higher-order phosphorylation involving t370, t376, and t379 specifically requires grk2/3 isoforms, and the same sequence controls opioid receptor internalization in neurons. these results reveal a biochemical mechanism differentiating the endocytic activity of opioid drugs.	@norel@
tcdd inhibition of canonical wnt signaling disrupts prostatic bud formation in mouse urogenital sinus. in mice, in utero exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin (tcdd) reduces the number of dorsolateral prostatic buds resulting in a smaller dorsolateral prostate and prevents formation of ventral buds culminating in ventral prostate agenesis. the genes and signaling pathways affected by tcdd that are responsible for disrupting prostate development are largely unknown. here we show that treatment of urogenital sinus (ugs) organ cultures with known inhibitors of canonical wnt signaling also inhibits prostatic bud formation. in support of the hypothesis that tcdd decreases canonical wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of tcdd on multiple components of the canonical wnt signaling pathway in the ugs that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of tcdd on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of r-spondins (rspo2 and rspo3) that promote canonical wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of lef1, tcf1, and wif1, established canonical wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of lgr5, a rspo receptor that activates canonical wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of dickkopfs (dkks), inhibitors of canonical wnt signaling, is not increased by tcdd. thus, the tcdd-induced reduction in canonical wnt signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (rspo2 and rspo3) rather than an increase in inhibitors (dkk1 and dkk2) of the pathway. this study focuses on determining whether treatment of tcdd-exposed ugs organ cultures with rspo2 and/or rspo3 is capable of rescuing the inhibitory effects of tcdd on canonical wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation. we discovered that each rspo alone or in combination partially rescues tcdd inhibition of both canonical wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation.	tcdd @chemical@ rspo2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ rspo3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ dkk1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ dkk2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ lgr5 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ rspo receptor @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ r-spondins @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ rspo2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ rspo3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ lef1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ tcf1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ wif1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ wnt @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ wnt @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ wnt @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ wnt @gene@ @cpr:4@ tcdd @chemical@ wnt @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
enhanced mglu5-receptor dependent long-term depression at the schaffer collateral-ca1 synapse of congenitally learned helpless rats. alterations of the glutamatergic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depression. in order to investigate the expression and function of mglu5 receptors in an animal model for treatment-resistant depression we used rats bred for congenital learned helplessness (clh) and the control strain, bred for resistance against inescapable stress, congenitally. not learned helpless rats (cnlh). western blot analysis showed an increased expression of mglu5 (but not mglu1a) receptors in the hippocampus of clh rats, as compared with control cnlh rats. we also examined mglu1/5 receptor signaling by in vivo measurement of dhpg-stimulated polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis. stimulation of (3)h-inositolmonophosphate formation induced by i.c.v. injection of dhpg was enhanced by about 50% in the hippocampus of clh rats. correspondingly, dhpg-induced long-term depression (ltd) at schaffer collateral/ca1 pyramidal cell synapses was amplified in hippocampal slices of clh rats, whereas ltd induced by low frequency stimulation of the schaffer collaterals did not change. moreover, these effects were associated with decreased basal dendritic spine density of ca1 pyramidal cell in clh rats. these data raise the attractive possibility that changes in the expression and function of mglu5 receptors in the hippocampus might underlie the changes in synaptic plasticity associated with the depressive-like phenotype of clh rats. however, chronic treatment of clh rats with mpep did not reverse learned helplessness, indicating that the enhanced mglu5 receptor function is not the only player in the behavioral phenotype of this genetic model of depression. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'metabotropic glutamate receptors'.	mpep @chemical@ mglu5 receptor @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
cellular effects of imatinib on medullary thyroid cancer cells harboring multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a and 2b associated ret mutations. background: activating mutations in the ret gene, which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor, often cause medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc). surgical resection is the only curative treatment; no effective systemic treatment is available. we evaluated imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as a potential drug for systemic treatment of mtc, in 2 mtc-derived cell lines expressing multiple endocrine neoplasia-associated mutant ret receptors. methods: we determined ret expression and y1062 phosphorylation using western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we determined the effects on cell proliferation by a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and we used fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with annexin v/propidium iodide staining to study imatinib-induced cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell death. results: imatinib inhibited ret y1062 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner after 1.5 hours of exposure. after 16 hours both ret y1062 phosphorylation and protein expression levels were affected. dose-dependent decreases in cell proliferation of both cell lines after exposure to imatinib with inhibitory concentration of 50% levels of 23 +/- 2 micromol/l and 25 +/- 4 micromol/l were seen. these values are high, compared with those for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. we further could show that imatinib induced cell-cycle arrest, and apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death. conclusions: imatinib inhibits ret-mediated mtc cell growth affecting ret protein levels in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. the concentration of imatinib necessary to inhibit ret in vitro, however, makes it impossible to conclude that imatinib monotherapy will be a good option for systemic therapy of mtc.	imatinib @chemical@ ret @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ ret @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ y1062 @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ ret @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ ret @gene@ @cpr:4@ imatinib @chemical@ tyrosine kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
a human hemi-cornea model for eye irritation testing: quality control of production, reliability and predictive capacity. we have developed a 3-dimensional human hemi-cornea which comprises an immortalized epithelial cell line and keratocytes embedded in a collagen stroma. in the present study, we have used mtt reduction of the whole tissue to clarify whether the production of this complex 3-d-model is transferable into other laboratories and whether these tissues can be constructed reproducibly. our results demonstrate the reproducible production of the hemi-cornea model according to standard operation procedures using 15 independent batches of reconstructed hemi-cornea models in two independent laboratories each. furthermore, the hemi-cornea tissues have been treated with 20 chemicals of different eye-irritating potential under blind conditions to assess the performance and limitations of our test system comparing three different prediction models. the most suitable prediction model revealed an overall in vitro-in vivo concordance of 80% and 70% in the participating laboratories, respectively, and an inter-laboratory concordance of 80%. sensitivity of the test was 77% and specificity was between 57% and 86% to discriminate classified from non-classified chemicals. we conclude that additional physiologically relevant endpoints in both epithelium and stroma have to be developed for the reliable prediction of all ghs classes of eye irritation in one stand alone test system.	@norel@
sulindac sulfide inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 and bad in human colon cancer cells. colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the united states. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including sulindac are promising chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer. sulindac and selective cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors cause regression of colonic polyps in familial polyposis patients. sulindac induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. in tumor cells, activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (erk) 1/2 results in phosphorylation of several erk1/2 effectors, including the proapoptotic protein bad. phosphorylation of ser112 by erk1/2 inactivates bad and protects the tumor cell from apoptosis. sulindac metabolites and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selectively inhibit erk1/2 phosphorylation in human colon cancer cells. in this study we show that epidermal growth factor (egf) strongly induces phosphorylation of erk1/2 and bad in ht29 colon cancer cells. egf-stimulated phosphorylation of erk and bad is blocked by pretreatment with u0126, a selective map kinase kinase (mkk)1/2 inhibitor. similarly, pretreatment with sulindac sulfide blocks the ability of egf to induce erk1/2 and bad phosphorylation, but also down-regulates total bad but not erk1/2 protein levels. the ability of sulindac to block erk1/2 signaling by the egf receptor may account for at least part of its potent growth-inhibitory effects against cancer cells.	sulindac @chemical@ erk1/2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac sulfide @chemical@ bad @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac @chemical@ erk1/2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ u0126 @chemical@ map kinase kinase (mkk)1/2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ u0126 @chemical@ egf @gene@ @cpr:4@ u0126 @chemical@ erk @gene@ @cpr:4@ u0126 @chemical@ bad @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac sulfide @chemical@ egf @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac sulfide @chemical@ bad @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac @chemical@ egf receptor @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac @chemical@ cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac sulfide @chemical@ bad @gene@ @cpr:4@ sulindac sulfide @chemical@ epidermal growth factor @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
cloning, functional expression and brain localization of a novel unconventional outward rectifier k+ channel. human twik-1, which has been cloned recently, is a new structural type of weak inward rectifier k+ channel. here we report the structural and functional properties of trek-1, a mammalian twik-1-related k+ channel. despite a low amino acid identity between twik-1 and trek-1 (approximately 28%), both channel proteins share the same overall structural arrangement consisting of two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments (tms). this structural similarity does not give rise to a functional analogy. k+ currents generated by twik-1 are inwardly rectifying while k+ currents generated by trek-1 are outwardly rectifying. these channels have a conductance of 14 ps. trek-1 currents are insensitive to pharmacological agents that block twik-1 activity such as quinine and quinidine. extensive inhibitions of trek-1 activity are observed after activation of protein kinases a and c. trek-1 currents are sensitive to extracellular k+ and na+. trek-1 mrna is expressed in most tissues and is particularly abundant in the lung and in the brain. its localization in this latter tissue has been studied by in situ hybridization. trek-1 expression is high in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebellum. these results provide the first evidence for the existence of a k+ channel family with four tms and two pore domains in the nervous system of mammals. they also show that different members in this structural family can have totally different functional properties.	quinine @chemical@ twik-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ quinidine @chemical@ twik-1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the platelet p2 receptors as molecular targets for old and new antiplatelet drugs. platelet activation by adp and atp plays a crucial role in haemostasis and thrombosis, and their so-called p2 receptors are potential targets for antithrombotic drugs. the atp-gated channel p2x1 and the 2 g protein-coupled p2y1 and p2y12 adp receptors selectively contribute to platelet aggregation. the p2y1 receptor is responsible for adp-induced shape change and weak and transient aggregation, while the p2y12 receptor is responsible for the completion and amplification of the response to adp and to all platelet agonists, including thromboxane a2 (txa2), thrombin, and collagen. the p2x1 receptor is involved in platelet shape change and in activation by collagen under shear conditions. due to its central role in the formation and stabilization of a thrombus, the p2y12 receptor is a well-established target of antithrombotic drugs like ticlopidine or clopidogrel, which have proved efficacy in many clinical trials and experimental models of thrombosis. competitive p2y12 antagonists have also been shown to be effective in experimental thrombosis as well as in several clinical trials. studies in p2y1 and p2x1 knockout mice and experimental thrombosis models using selective p2y1 and p2x1 antagonists have shown that, depending on the conditions, these receptors could also be potential targets for new antithrombotic drugs.	@norel@
modulation of cytochrome p450 1 (cyp1) by vanadium in hepatic tissue and isolated hepatocyte of c57bl/6 mice. the objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of vanadium (v(5+)) on cyp1 expression and activity in c57bl/6 mice liver and isolated hepatocytes. for this purpose, c57bl6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with v(5+) (5 mg/kg) in the absence and presence of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) (15 μg/kg) for 6 and 24 h. furthermore, isolated hepatocytes from c57bl6 mice were treated with v(5+) (5, 10, and 20 μm) in the absence and presence of tcdd (1 nm) for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. in vivo, v(5+) alone did not significantly alter cyp1a1, cyp1a2, or cyp1b1 mrna, protein, or catalytic activity levels. upon co-exposure to v(5+) and tcdd, v(5+) significantly potentiated the tcdd-mediated induction of the cyp1a1, cyp1a2, and cyp1b1 mrna, protein, and catalytic activity levels at 24 h. in vitro, v(5+) decreased the tcdd-mediated induction of cyp1a1 mrna, protein, and catalytic activity levels. furthermore, v(5+) significantly inhibited the tcdd-induced ahr-dependent luciferase activity. v(5+) also increased serum hemoglobin (hb) levels in animals treated for 24 h. upon treatment of isolated hepatocytes with hb alone or in the presence of tcdd, there was an increase in the ahr-dependent luciferase activity. when isolated hepatocytes were treated for 2 h with v(5+) in the presence of tcdd, followed by replacement of the medium with new medium containing hb, there was further potentiation to the tcdd-mediated effect. the present study demonstrates that there is a differential modulation of cyp1a1 by v(5+) in c57bl/6 mice livers and isolated hepatocytes and demonstrates hb as an in vivo specific modulator.	tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1b1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ cyp1a2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ cyp1b1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ cyp1a2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ cyp1b1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1b1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ serum hemoglobin @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ hb @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1b1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ v(5+) @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ v(5+) @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
preclinical properties of 18f-av-45: a pet agent for abeta plaques in the brain. unlabelled: beta-amyloid plaques (abeta plaques) in the brain, containing predominantly fibrillary abeta peptide aggregates, represent a defining pathologic feature of alzheimer disease (ad). imaging agents targeting the abeta plaques in the living human brain are potentially valuable as biomarkers of pathogenesis processes in ad.

effect of thiazolidinediones on equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 in human aortic smooth muscle cells. thiazolidinediones are a new class of anti-diabetic agents which increase insulin sensitivity by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar(gamma)) and stimulating the expression of insulin-responsive genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. these drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. however the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ent). the present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on ent1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (hasmcs). although incubating hasmcs for 48h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ent1 mrna and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3h]adenosine uptake and [3h]nbmpr binding of hasmcs with ic50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microm, respectively. the effect of troglitazone on ent1 was ppar(gamma)-independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ent1. in contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3h]adenosine uptake by hasmcs. troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a vitamin e moiety. the difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ent1 because vitamin e did not inhibit [3h]adenosine uptake by hasmcs. using the nucleoside transporter deficient pk15ntd cells stably expressing ent1 and ent2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ent1 but had no effect on ent2. from these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ent1. pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ent1.	thiazolidinediones @chemical@ insulin @gene@ @cpr:3@ thiazolidinediones @chemical@ insulin @gene@ @cpr:3@ troglitazone @chemical@ ent1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ troglitazone @chemical@ ent1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ troglitazone @chemical@ ent1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ troglitazone @chemical@ ent1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ troglitazone @chemical@ ent1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
in vitro exploration of potential mechanisms of toxicity of the human hepatotoxic drug fenclozic acid. the carboxylic acid nsaid fenclozic acid exhibited an excellent preclinical safety profile and promising clinical efficacy, yet was withdrawn from clinical development in 1971 due to hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials. a variety of modern in vitro approaches have been used to explore potential underlying mechanisms. covalent binding studies were undertaken with [(14)c]-fenclozic acid to investigate the possible role of reactive metabolites. time-dependent covalent binding to protein was observed in nadph-supplemented liver microsomes, although no metabolites were detected in these incubations or in reactive metabolite trapping experiments. in human hepatocytes, covalent binding was observed at lower levels than in microsomes and a minor uncharacterizable metabolite was also observed. in addition, covalent binding was observed in incubations undertaken with dog and rat hepatocytes, where a taurine conjugate of the drug was detected. although an acyl glucuronide metabolite was detected when liver microsomes from human, rat and dog were supplemented with udpga, there was no detectable udpga-dependent covalent binding. no effects were observed when fenclozic acid was assessed for p450-dependent and p450-independent cytotoxicity to thle cell lines, time-dependent inhibition of five major human cytochrome p450 enzymes, inhibition of the biliary efflux transporters bsep and mrp2 or mitochondrial toxicity to thle or hepg2 cells. these data suggest that phase 1 bioactivation plays a role in the hepatotoxicity of fenclozic acid and highlight the unique insight into mechanisms of human drug toxicity that can be provided by investigations of biotransformation and covalent binding to proteins.	fenclozic acid @chemical@ human cytochrome p450 @gene@ @cpr:4@ fenclozic acid @chemical@ efflux transporters @gene@ @cpr:4@ fenclozic acid @chemical@ bsep @gene@ @cpr:4@ fenclozic acid @chemical@ mrp2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
ifn-gamma-induced ido and wrs expression in microglia is differentially regulated by il-4. indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido), a tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. ido expression is induced by ifn-gamma and leads to neurotoxicity by generating quinolinic acid. additionally, it inhibits the immune response through both tryptophan depletion and generating other tryptophan catabolites. il-4 and il-13 have been shown to control ido expression by antagonizing the effects of ifn-gamma in different cell types. here, we investigated the effects of these cytokines on ido expression in microglia. interestingly, we observed that both il-4 and il-13 greatly enhanced ifn-gamma-induced ido expression. however, tryptophanyl-trna synthetase (wrs), which is coinduced with ido by ifn-gamma, is downregulated by il-4 and il-13. the effect of il-4 and il-13 was independent of stat-6. modulation of ido but not wrs was eliminated by inhibition of protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) activity. the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathway further differentiated the regulation of these two enzymes, as inhibiting the pi3k pathway eliminated ifn-gamma induction of ido, whereas such inhibition greatly enhanced wrs expression. these findings show discordance between modulations of expression of two distinct enzymes utilizing tryptophan as a common substrate, and raise the possibility of their involvement in regulating immune responses in various neurological disorders.	tryptophan @chemical@ ido @gene@ @cpr:9@ tryptophan @chemical@ indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
screening of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors by ce after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet. in this study the development of a procedure based on capillary electrophoresis after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet methodology for the screening and in vitro evaluation of the biological activity of acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitors is presented. the progress of the enzymatic reaction of the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine at ph 8 in the presence of ache and the inhibitor studied is determined by measuring at 230 nm the peak area of the reaction product thiocholine (tch). in the method employed the capillary was first filled with 30 mm borate-phosphate buffer (ph 8.0) and subsequently, plugs of: (i) water, (ii) ache solution, (iii) substrate solution with or without inhibitor, (iv) ache solution, and (v) water, were hydrodynamically injected into the capillary, and were allowed to stand (and react) during a waiting period of 2 min. the applicability of the proposed methodology to estimate different kinetic parameters of interest such as inhibition constants k(i), identification of inhibitory action mechanism and ic(50), is evaluated using compounds with known activity, tacrine edrophonium, and neostigmine. the results obtained are compared with bibliographic values and confirm the effectiveness of the methodology proposed. finally a method for ache inhibitor screening is proposed.	acetylthiocholine @chemical@ ache @gene@ @cpr:9@

pelargonidin activates the ahr and induces cyp1a1 in primary human hepatocytes and human cancer cell lines hepg2 and ls174t. we examined the effects of anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, pelargonidin) on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr)-cyp1a1 signaling pathway in human hepatocytes, hepatic hepg2 and intestinal ls174t cancer cells. ahr-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected hepg2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of cyp1a1 mrna up to 5-fold in hepg2 and ls174t cells relative to the induction by 5 nm 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (tcdd), the most potent activator of ahr. cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 mrnas were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of tcdd potency) and the increase in cyp1a1 protein in hepg2 and ls174t cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of cyp1a1 enzyme. ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of ahr. enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of cyp1a1 activity by delphinidin (ic50 78 μm) and pelargonidin (ic50 33 μm). overall, although most anthocyanidins had no effects on ahr-cyp1a1 signaling, pelargonidin can bind to and activate the ahr and ahr-dependent gene expression, and pelargonidin and delphinidin inhibit the cyp1a1 catalytic activity.	2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ cyp1a2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ ahr @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ pelargonidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ tcdd @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ delphinidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pelargonidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pelargonidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ delphinidin @chemical@ cyp1a1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
an indian butyrylcholinesterase variant l307p is not structurally stable: a molecular dynamics simulation study. the human butyrylcholinesterase (bche) activity is less than 1% in the serum of silent variant individuals of vysya community in india. they are homozygous for a point mutation at codon 307 (ctt→cct) resulting in the substitution of leucine 307 by proline. the reason for the disappearance of the protein in the serum has not been explicated till date. based on this background, we performed molecular dynamics simulation to probe the structural stability of indian variant (l307p) in comparison with wild and other bche variants (d70g, e497v, v142m) having differential esterase activity. the simulation of all the mutants except d70g showed a much larger cα root mean square deviation from the wild bche crystal structure, showing the overall conformational disturbance. further analysis revealed that secondary structure of the mutant proteins was not stable. the orientation of the catalytic triad is also distorted in all the mutants. the distance between δ nitrogen of his438 to ε oxygen of glu325 and ε nitrogen of his438 to γ oxygen of ser198 were highly altered in l307p mutant than the wild and other three variants throughout the simulation. such disparity of distances between the catalytic residues may be due to the change in the protein conformation attributing to their differential catalytic activity. our studies thus prove that the indian bche l307p mutant with negligible activity is possibly due to its structural instability when compared to other bche variants.	@norel@
characterization of tyrosinase inhibitors in the twigs of cudrania tricuspidata and their structure-activity relationship study. the twigs of cudrania tricuspidata were found to show strong tyrosinase inhibitory activity, and further detailed component analysis resulted in the isolation of a new flavanol glucoside, (2s,3s)-2,3-trans-dihydromorin-7-o-β-d-glucoside (1), plus twenty-seven known compounds (2-28). their structures were elucidated on the basis of esi-ms and nmr spectral data. among the isolated compounds, trans-dihydromorin (8), oxyresveratrol (9), and steppogenin (12) were found to exhibit significant tyrosinase inhibition activities. moreover, the structure-activity relationship of these isolated compounds was also discussed.	trans-dihydromorin @chemical@ tyrosinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ oxyresveratrol @chemical@ tyrosinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ steppogenin @chemical@ tyrosinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor regulation of spinal norepinephrine release. background: neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) agonists produce antinociception in animals. nachrs exist almost exclusively on presynaptic terminals in the central nervous system and stimulate neurotransmitter release. this study tested whether nachr agonists stimulate spinal release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine either by direct actions on noradrenergic terminals or indirectly by stimulating release of other neurotransmitters to induce norepinephrine release. methods: adult male rats were anesthetized and microdialysis probes inserted in the l2-l4 dermatomes of the spinal cord. probes were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing nicotine, the specific alpha(4)beta(2*) nachr agonist metanicotine, or nicotine plus nachr antagonists and norepinephrine measured in the microdialysates. the effects of specific glutamate receptor antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors were also examined. to determine direct effects on noradrenergic terminals, synaptosomes were prepared from spinal cord and incubated with nachr agonists and antagonists. results: both nicotine and metanicotine induced norepinephrine release in spinal microdialsyates, an effect reduced by nicotinic antagonists but not glutamate antagonists or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. both of the nicotinic agonists stimulated norepinephrine release in synaptosomes, and the effect of metanicotine was blocked at lower concentrations of alpha(4)beta(2*)- than alpha(7*)-preferring nachr antagonists. conclusion: these results suggest that one mechanism by which nachr agonists act for analgesia is to stimulate spinal norepinephrine release. they do so by actions on alpha(4)beta(2*) nachrs, and perhaps other subtypes, most likely located on noradrenergic terminals, rather than by indirectly stimulating norepinephrine release through glutamate release or nitric oxide synthesis.	metanicotine @chemical@ alpha(4)beta(2*) nachr @gene@ @cpr:5@ nicotine @chemical@ alpha(4)beta(2*) nachr @gene@ @cpr:5@ 
[study on the effect of cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist, pranlukast hydrate, on adhesive interaction between eosinophils and pulmonary endothelial cells]. it has been reported that cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) antagonists reduce the accumulation of eosinophils in the asthmatic airway. however, the exact mechanism of this action remains to be established. in the present study, we examined whether a cyslt antagonist modifies the adhesive interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells. pranlukast hydrate, a cyslt antagonist, blocked the chemotactic response and adhesion of eosinophils induced by ltd4. on the other hand, pranlukast did not modify the eosinophil spontaneous adhesion to the resting or il-4 plus tnf-alpha-stimulated pulmonary endothelial cells. similarly, pranlukast did not modulate il-5- or fmlp-activated eosinophil adhesion to the resting endothelial cells. finally, pranlukast did not modify the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells stimulated with endothelial activating cytokines. these results suggest that the inhibitory action of cyslt antagonist on eosinophil accumulation in the asthmatic airways involves mechanisms other than the adhesive interaction between eosinophils and endothelial cells.	@norel@
quantitation of ugt1a1 in human liver microsomes using stable isotope-labelled peptides and mass spectrometry based proteomic approaches. 1. udp-glucuronosyltransferases (ugts) are a group of drug-metabolizing enzymes that catalyse the conjugation of endogeonous compounds and xenobiotics to yield hydrophilic glucuronides which subsequently undergo excretion. this report describes an approach for the identification and accurate quantitation of human ugt1a1 in complex biological matrices using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) analysis of protein digests. 2. a stable isotope-labelled (sil) peptide of a unique peptide spanning residues 54-69 in exon 1 of the human ugt1a1 protein with the sequence riylsadpalvviehg was synthesized. the peptide sequence synthesized was in the reverse order of the human peptide with the stable isotope-labels in the amino acid arginine ((13)c6(15)n4) resulting in an increase in the mass of the sil peptide of 10 amu, from 1753 to 1763. the sil peptide was quantitated by injecting increasing concentrations of the peptide into the lc-ms to obtain a standard curve. 3. the labelled peptide along with precursor ion monitoring was used to quantify the levels of ugt1a1 in commercial recombinant preparations (supersomes) and individual human liver microsomal samples and pooled human liver micrsomes obtained from bd biosciences. 4. glucuronidation activity studies were performed, which demonstrated a positive correlation between enzyme activity levels and the ugt1a1 content in the liver microsomes obtained from individual human donors.	@norel@
differential il-2 receptor expression in renal allograft recipients treated with an anti-il-2-receptor antibody. patients were entered into a randomized trial of prophylaxis for renal allograft rejection by the administration of an anti-human il-2 receptor antibody, anti-tac, during the first ten days posttransplant. interleukin-2 receptor (il-2 r) expression was measured using two anti-il-2 r monoclonal antibodies (moabs), anti-tac and 1ht4-4h3. these two antibodies recognize closely spaced epitopes on the 55 kd chain of the il-2 r. il-2 r expression was examined on peripheral blood small lymphocytes in three groups of patients who received: (a) cyclosporine csa and prednisone for baseline immunosuppression (n = 9); (b) anti-tac with csa and prednisone as baseline immunosuppression (n = 12); and (c) anti-tac with azathioprine and prednisone as baseline immunosuppression (n = 5). we found that large numbers of t cells express il-2 receptors despite the presence of anti-tac (average of il-2 r-positive cells at day of peak il-2 r expression 56.0 +/- 20.8% in group a, 65.2 +/- 26.6% in group b, 21.0 +/- 7.4% in group c). il-2 r expression did not correlate with clinical activity, and the presence or accessibility of epitopes on the same 55 kd chain varied dramatically from patient to patient.	@norel@
chi-conopeptide mria partially overlaps desipramine and cocaine binding sites on the human norepinephrine transporter. the interactions of chi-conopeptide mria with the human norepinephrine transporter (hnet) were investigated by determining the effects of hnet point mutations on the inhibitory potency of mria. the mutants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in cos-7 cells. the potency of mria was greater for inhibition of uptake by hnet of [3h]norepinephrine (ki 1.89 microm) than [3h]dopamine (ki 4.33 microm), and the human dopamine transporter and serotonin transporter were not inhibited by mria (to 7 microm). of 18 mutations where hnet amino acid residues were exchanged with those of the human dopamine transporter, mria had increased potency for inhibition of [3h]norepinephrine uptake for three mutations (in predicted extracellular loops 3 and 4 and transmembrane domain (tmd) 8) and decreased potency for one mutation (in tmd6 and intracellular loop (il) 3). of the 12 additional mutations in tmds 2, 4, 5, and 11 and il1, three mutations (in tmd2 and il1) had reduced mria inhibitory potency. all of the other mutations tested had no influence on mria potency. a comparison of the results with previous data for desipramine and cocaine inhibition of norepinephrine uptake by the mutant hnets reveals that mria binding to hnet occurs at a site that is distinct from but overlaps with the binding sites for tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine.	norepinephrine @chemical@ hnets @gene@ @cpr:9@ [3h]norepinephrine @chemical@ hnet @gene@ @cpr:9@ [3h]dopamine @chemical@ hnet @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
life-threatening hypoglycemia associated with intentional insulin ingestion. there are reports of insulin overdose by injection, yet little is known regarding the potential harms of intentional oral ingestion of insulin. in this report, we describe a case of massive insulin ingestion and ensuing hypoglycemia. to our knowledge, there are no previously published cases of hypoglycemia caused by intentional insulin ingestion. a 51-year-old man intentionally ingested three 10-ml vials (total of 3000 units) of various insulins: one vial each of insulin aspart, lispro, and glargine. four symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes, with blood glucose levels of 48, 25, 34, and 40 mg/dl, occurred approximately 1, 3, 4, and 5 hours, respectively, after ingestion. the hypoglycemia could not be explained other than the ingestion of the insulins. the patient was admitted for observation, and euglycemia occurred within 24 hours without any additional hypoglycemic episodes. hypoglycemia treatment is reviewed in this case report, and factors that may affect systemic response of orally ingested insulin, including gastrointestinal absorption and insulin sensitivity, are discussed. in addition, the findings of our case report may provide useful insight into the development of novel oral insulin products that are currently in research. despite poor bioavailability (1%) when taken orally, insulin may produce symptomatic hypoglycemia with a massive ingestion. vigilant blood glucose monitoring, supportive care with glucose replacement therapy, and admission to the hospital for observation may be required.	@norel@
structure of human microsomal cytochrome p450 2c8. evidence for a peripheral fatty acid binding site. a 2.7-angstrom molecular structure of human microsomal cytochrome p450 2c8 (cyp2c8) was determined by x-ray crystallography. the membrane protein was modified for crystallization by replacement of the hydrophobic n-terminal transmembrane domain with a short hydrophilic sequence before residue 28. the structure of the native sequence is complete from residue 28 to the beginning of a c-terminal histidine tag used for purification. cyp2c8 is one of the principal hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes that oxidizes therapeutic drugs such as taxol and cerivastatin and endobiotics such as retinoic acid and arachidonic acid. consistent with the relatively large size of its preferred substrates, the active site volume is twice that observed for the structure of cyp2c5. the extended active site cavity is bounded by the beta1 sheet and helix f' that have not previously been implicated in substrate recognition by mammalian p450s. cyp2c8 crystallized as a symmetric dimer formed by the interaction of helices f, f', g', and g. two molecules of palmitic acid are bound in the dimer interface. the dimer is observed in solution, and mass spectrometry confirmed the association of palmitic acid with the enzyme. this novel finding identifies a peripheral binding site in p450s that may contribute to drug-drug interactions in p450 metabolism.	@norel@
captopril attenuates matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in rats. little is known about the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors on matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) in right ventricular remodeling. we investigated the effect of captopril, an ace inhibitor, on mmp-2 and mmp-9 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy. six-week-old male wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with monocrotaline (60 mg/kg) or saline. the rats were administrated captopril (30 mg/kg per day) or a vehicle orally for 24 days from the day of monocrotaline injection. at day 25, echocardiography was performed and hearts were excised. expressions and activities of mmp-2 and mmp-9 were measured by western blotting and by gelatin zymography, respectively. in monocrotaline-injected rats, right ventricular weight/tail length ratio increased significantly. histological analysis revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in right ventricular sections. echocardiography showed right ventricular dysfunction compared with saline-injected rats. the right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction were inhibited by captopril. however, captopril did not attenuate an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. mmp-2 and mmp-9 expressions and activities in right ventricles increased significantly in monocrotaline-injected rats and captopril inhibited them. these findings indicate that captopril attenuates the development of monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in association with inhibition of mmp-2 and mmp-9 in rats.	monocrotaline @chemical@ mmp-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ monocrotaline @chemical@ mmp-9 @gene@ @cpr:3@ monocrotaline @chemical@ mmp-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ monocrotaline @chemical@ mmp-9 @gene@ @cpr:3@ monocrotaline @chemical@ mmp-2 @gene@ @cpr:3@ monocrotaline @chemical@ mmp-9 @gene@ @cpr:3@ captopril @chemical@ mmp-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ captopril @chemical@ mmp-9 @gene@ @cpr:4@ captopril @chemical@ mmp-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ captopril @chemical@ mmp-9 @gene@ @cpr:4@ captopril @chemical@ mmp-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ captopril @chemical@ mmp-9 @gene@ @cpr:4@ captopril @chemical@ ace @gene@ @cpr:4@

hospitalized osteoporotic vertebral fracture increases the risk of stroke: a population-based cohort study. the association between osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated. higher cardiovascular risk has also been correlated with vertebral fractures. however, the association between osteoporotic vertebral fracture and the possibly higher risk of stroke remains uncertain. this study aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk, and type of stroke in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture. patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture were identified (n = 380) and 10 age- and sex-matched controls per case (comparison group, n = 3795) were chosen from a nationwide representative cohort of 999,997 people from 1998 to 2005. both groups were followed-up for stroke events for 3 years, matched by propensity scores with adjustments for covariates such as comorbidities (ie, hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmia, or coronary heart diseases) and exposure to medications (ie, aspirin, lipid lowering drug, or nitrates), and assessed by kaplan-meier and cox regression analyses. the incidence rate of stroke in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture group (37.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [ci], 27.5-51.2) was significantly higher than in the comparison group (14.0 per 1000 person-years; 95% ci, 12.0-16.4, p < 0.001). stroke was more likely to occur in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture patients than in the normal controls (crude hazard ratio [hr] 2.68, 95% ci 1.89-3.79, p < 0.001; adjusted hr 2.71, 95% ci 1.90-3.86, p < 0.001). in conclusion, patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture have a higher risk of stroke (ie, both ischemic and hemorrhagic) and require stroke prevention strategies.	@norel@
a 46-amino acid segment in phosphodiesterase-5 gaf-b domain provides for high vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil and is involved in phosphodiesterase-5 dimerization. phosphodiesterase-5 (pde5) contains a catalytic domain (c domain) that hydrolyzes cgmp and a regulatory domain (r domain) that contains two mammalian cgmp-binding phosphodiesterase, anabaena adenylyl cyclases, escherichia coli fhlas (gafs) (a and b) and a phosphorylation site for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (cnpks). binding of cgmp to gaf-a increases cnpk phosphorylation of pde5 and improves catalytic site affinity for cgmp or inhibitors. gaf-b contributes to dimerization of pde5, inhibition of cgmp binding to gaf-a, and sequestration of the phosphorylation site. to probe potential pde5 r domain effects on catalytic site affinity for certain inhibitors, four n-terminal truncation mutants were generated: pde5delta1-321 contained gaf-b domain, c domain, and the sequence between gaf-a and -b; pde5delta1-419 contained gaf-b and c domain; pde5delta1-465 contained the c domain and the c-terminal portion of gaf-b; and pde5delta1-534 contained only c domain. truncated proteins with a complete gaf-b were dimers, but those lacking the n-terminal 46 amino acids of gaf-b were monomers, indicating that these residues are vital for gaf-b-mediated pde5 dimerization. k(m) values of the mutants for cgmp were similar to that of full-length pde5. all pde5 constructs had similar affinities for 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, sildenafil, tadalafil, and uk-122764, but mutants containing a complete gaf-b had 7- to 18-fold higher affinity for vardenafil-based compounds compared with those lacking a complete gaf-b. this indicated that the n-terminal 46 amino acids in gaf-b are required for high vardenafil potency. this is the first evidence that pde5 r domain, and gaf-b in particular, influences affinity and selectivity of the catalytic site for certain classes of inhibitors.	cgmp @chemical@ cnpk @gene@ @cpr:3@ cgmp @chemical@ pde5 @gene@ @cpr:3@ cgmp @chemical@ phosphodiesterase-5 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cgmp @chemical@ pde5 @gene@ @cpr:9@ cgmp @chemical@ pde5 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
preclinical pharmacokinetics and in vitro metabolism of dasatinib (bms-354825): a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against src and bcr-abl. purpose: dasatinib (bms-354825), a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against src and bcr-abl, has recently been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) in imatinib-acquired resistance and intolerance. in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dasatinib in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of dasatinib in animals were investigated. methods: metabolic stability of dasatinib was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either nadph- or udpga-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. in all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. in addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of dasatinib to bile duct cannulated (bdc) rats. absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like caco-2 cells, p-glycoprotein (p-gp) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. results: in vivo systemic plasma clearance values of dasatinib were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. dasatinib showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. oral bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. in rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. in bdc rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that dasatinib is cleared primarily via metabolism. dasatinib has high intrinsic permeability in caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. however, in vivo studies in p-gp knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of dasatinib remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that p-gp may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. conclusions: dasatinib shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. the incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. however, the efflux transporter, p-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.	dasatinib @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ src @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ bcr @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ src @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ bcr @gene@ @cpr:4@ dasatinib @chemical@ abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ src @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ bcr @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ kinase @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ src @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ bcr @gene@ @cpr:4@ bms-354825 @chemical@ abl @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
highly selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors for the treatment of allergic skin diseases and psoriasis. the phosphodiesterase (pde) 4 is the predominant cyclic amp degrading enzyme in a variety of inflammatory cells including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, t cells and monocytes. in addition, this enzyme is expressed in non-immune cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts. highly selective pde4 inhibitors are currently under evaluation for the treatment of asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. due to the broad anti-inflammatory/immuno-modulatory action of pde4 inhibitors, it has been proposed that pde4 inhibitors might also be efficacious for skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. consequently, pde4 inhibitors including cilomilast and awd 12-281 have been tested in several models of allergic and irritant skin inflammation. these pde4 inhibitors displayed strong anti-inflammatory action in models of allergic contact dermatitis in mice, in the arachidonic acid induced skin inflammation in mice and in ovalbumin sensitised guinea pigs. the determination of cytokines in skin homogenates revealed that both th1 as well as th2 cytokines are suppressed by pde4 inhibitors, indicating an anti-inflammatory activity in both the th2 dominated acute phase as well as the th1 dominated chronic phase of atopic dermatitis. due to the suppression of th1 cytokines, activity can also be expected in psoriasis. results of early clinical trials with both topically (cipamfylline, cp80,633) and systemically (cc-10004) active pde4 inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in atopic dermatitis and in the case of cc-10004, also in psoriasis. awd 12-281 (gw 842470) is currently under clinical evaluation for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis. results concerning clinical efficacy of this potent and selective pde4 inhibitor are anxiously awaited.	cipamfylline @chemical@ pde4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ cp80,633 @chemical@ pde4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ cilomilast @chemical@ pde4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ awd 12-281 @chemical@ pde4 @gene@ @cpr:4@ cyclic amp @chemical@ phosphodiesterase (pde) 4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
toxicological impact of inhaled electric mosquito-repellent liquid on the rat: a hematological, cytokine indications, oxidative stress and tumor markers. abstract context: high malaria burden has led to the increased use of insecticides in the tropics and subtropics. this study thus aimed at assessing the hematological effects alteration of pyrethroid insecticide exposure using the experimental animal model. objective: a commonly available electric mosquito-repellent liquid pyrethroid insecticide containing prallethrin 1.6% w/w is widely used for mosquito control in saudi arabia. the immunotoxic effects after inhalation exposures to the preparation for a continuous period of 24, 48, and 72 h were investigated in rats. methods and materials: rats were exposed to prallethrin 1.6% w/w by inhalation for 72 consecutive hours. total blood count, blood indices of creatine kinase (ck), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-gt), superoxide dismutase (sod), nitric oxide (no), malondialdehyde (mda), interleukin (il)-2, tumor necrosis factors (tnf)α, alpha-fetoprotein (afp), carbohydrate antigen (ca) 19.9 and carcinoembrionic antigen (cea) were assayed. results: the administration of prallethrin 1.6% w/w created significant increased changes in the levels of total wbc, lymphocytes, rbc, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin in rats after 24, 48, and 72 h of continuous inhalation; however, there was a significant reduction in neutrophils at transient reduction in the monocytes after 24 and 48 h to return to normal after 72 h. significant increases in the levels of ck, γ-gt, sod, no, mda, afp, il-2, and tnfα were recorded. ca and cea did not exhibit any change. conclusions: continuous inhalation to prallethrin 1.6% insecticides poses toxicity on hematological variables. it is also concluded that pyrethroid group of insecticide may cause hematological, biochemical, cytokine disturbances and possible mutagenic damage to the tissues.	prallethrin @chemical@ hemoglobin @gene@ @cpr:3@ prallethrin @chemical@ hemoglobin @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
defective dna damage response and repair in liver cells expressing hepatitis b virus surface antigen. hepatitis b virus (hbv) is implicated in liver cancer. the aim of this study was to find out whether hbv or its components [hbv surface antigen (hbsag), hbv core protein (hbc), and hbv x protein (hbx)] could interfere with the host dna damage response and repair pathway. the full hbv genome or individual hbv open-reading frame (orf) was introduced into hepg2 cells to examine the effect on host genomic stability, dna repair efficacy in response to double-strand dna damage, and dna damage-induced cell death. responses to apoptosis induction in the hbv orf-transfected hepg2 cells were also compared with those in hbv-positive and hbv-negative human hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) cells. in the absence of hbv replication, accumulation of hbsag in liver cells without other hbv proteins enhanced dna repair protein and tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia (pml) degradation, which resulted in resistance to apoptosis induction and deficient double-strand dna repair. however, hbsag-positive cells exhibited increased cell death with exposure to the poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that blocks single-strand dna repair. these results indicate that suppression of pml by hbsag disrupts cellular mechanisms that respond to double-strand dna damage for dna repair or apoptosis induction, which may facilitate hepatocarcinogenesis and open up a synthetic lethality strategy for hbsag-positive hcc treatment.-chung, y.-l. defective dna damage response and repair in liver cells expressing hepatitis b virus surface antigen.	@norel@
contribution of the m1 transmembrane helix and pre-m1 region to positive allosteric modulation and gating of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels whose function is critical for normal excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain and whose dysfunction has been implicated in several neurologic conditions. nmda receptor function is subject to extensive allosteric regulation both by endogenous compounds and by exogenous small molecules. elucidating the structural determinants and mechanism of action by which allosteric regulators control gating will enhance our understanding of nmda receptor activation and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. here, we investigated the structural determinants for (3-chlorophenyl)(6,7-dimethoxy-1-((4-methoxyphenoxy)methyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1h)-yl)methanone (ciq), a glun2c/2d-selective positive allosteric modulator. we show that ciq does not bind to the amino-terminal domain of the nmda receptor and does not share structural determinants with modulators acting at the agonist-binding domain dimer interface or ion channel pore. rather, we identified critical determinants of ciq modulation in the region near the first transmembrane helix of glun2d, including in a putative pre-m1 cuff helix that may influence channel gating. we also show that mutations within the glun2d pre-m1 region alter open probability of the nmda receptor. these results suggest a novel site of action for potentiation of nmda receptors by small molecules and implicate the pre-m1 region in nmda receptor gating.	@norel@
the structure and properties of septin 3: a possible missing link in septin filament formation. the human genome codes for 13 members of a family of filament-forming gtp-binding proteins known as septins. these have been divided into four different subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity. the differences between the subgroups are believed to control their correct assembly into heterofilaments which have specific roles in membrane remodelling events. many different combinations of the 13 proteins are theoretically possible and it is therefore important to understand the structural basis of specific filament assembly. however, three-dimensional structures are currently available for only three of the four subgroups. in the present study we describe the crystal structure of a construct of human sept3 which belongs to the outstanding subgroup. this construct (sept3-gc), which includes the gtp-binding and c-terminal domains, purifies as a nucleotide-free monomer, allowing for its characterization in terms of gtp-binding and hydrolysis. in the crystal structure, sept3-gc forms foreshortened filaments which employ the same nc and g interfaces observed in the heterotrimeric complex of human septins 2, 6 and 7, reinforcing the notion of 'promiscuous' interactions described previously. in the present study we describe these two interfaces and relate the structure to its tendency to form monomers and its efficiency in the hydrolysis of gtp. the relevance of these results is emphasized by the fact that septins from the sept3 subgroup may be important determinants of polymerization by occupying the terminal position in octameric units which themselves form the building blocks of at least some heterofilaments.	@norel@
neuropsychological and conditioned blocking performance in patients with schizophrenia: assessment of the contribution of neuroleptic dose, serum levels and dopamine d2-receptor occupancy. patients with schizophrenia show impairments of attention and neuropsychological performance, but the extent to which this is attributable to antipsychotic medication remains largely unexplored. we describe here the putative influence of the dose of antipsychotic medication (chlorpromazine equivalents, cpz), the antipsychotic serum concentration of dopamine (da) d2-blocking activity and the approximated central dopamine d2-receptor occupancy (da d2-occupancy), on conditioned blocking (cb) measures of attention and performance on a neuropsychological battery, in 108 patients with schizophrenia (compared with 62 healthy controls). antipsychotic serum concentration and d2-occupancy were higher in patients with a paranoid versus non-paranoid diagnosis, and in female versus male patients (independent of symptom severity). controlling for d2-occupancy removed the difference between high cb in paranoid and impaired low cb in non-paranoid patients. similar partial correlations for antipsychotic drug dose and serum levels of da d2-blocking activity with performance of the trail-making and picture completion tests (negative) and the block-design task (positive) showed the functional importance of da-related activity. high estimates of central da d2-occupancy were related to impaired verbal fluency but were associated with improved recall of stories, especially in paranoid patients. this, the first study of its kind, tentatively imputes a role for da d2-related activity in left frontal (e.g. cb, verbal fluency) and temporal lobe functions (verbal recall) as well as in some non-verbal abilities mediated more in the right hemisphere in patients with schizophrenia.	@norel@
diet, physical exercise and orlistat administration increase serum anti-müllerian hormone (amh) levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). the present study investigates the combined effect of diet, physical exercise and orlistat for 24 weeks, on serum anti-müllerian hormone (amh) levels in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) and in overweight and obese controls. sixty-one (61) selected women with pcos and 20 overweight and obese controls followed an energy-restricted diet, physical exercise plus orlistat administration (120 mg, 3 times per day) for 24 weeks. at baseline, week 12 and week 24, serum levels of amh, fsh, lh, prl, androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg), glucose, and insulin were measured and free androgen index (fai) and insulin resistance (ir) indices were calculated. in pcos women, serum amh levels increased after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. after 12 weeks lh and shbg were increased, while testosterone decreased. after 12 and 24 weeks, fai was decreased and all indices of ir were significantly improved. we concluded that in overweight and obese women with pcos orlistat administration, combined with diet and physical exercise, for 24 weeks, resulted in significant weight loss, improvement of hyperandrogenism and insulin sensitivity, and increased serum amh levels.	orlistat @chemical@ amh @gene@ @cpr:3@ orlistat @chemical@ anti-müllerian hormone @gene@ @cpr:3@ orlistat @chemical@ amh @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
neurochemical effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine on brain gaba and alanine: a comparison with vigabatrin. purpose: to compare phenelzine (plz), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits monoamine oxidase (mao) but also elevates rat brain levels of the amino acids ?-aminobutyric acid (gaba) and alanine (ala), with vigabatrin (vig), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain gaba by inhibition of gaba transaminase (gaba-t), with regard to their actions on brain levels of gaba and ala and on activities of mao, gaba-t and ala transaminase (ala-t). methods: male rats were administered plz (10 mg/kg) or vig (1,000 mg/kg) i.p., and the rats were euthanized 4 hours later and the brains removed for analysis of levels of gaba and ala (by electron capture gas chromatography after derivatization) and activities of mao, gaba-t and ala-t (radiochemical assays). results: both plz and vig inhibited gaba-t and elevated gaba levels. only plz inhibited mao and ala-t and elevated ala levels. the effects of plz on both amino acids and their transaminases were blocked by pre-treatment with the mao inhibitor tranylcypromine. this pretreament had no effect on the inhibition of gaba-t or the elevation of brain gaba levels produced by vig. conclusions: at the doses studied, plz was as effective as vig at elevating brain gaba levels, but, unlike vig, also inhibited mao and ala-t (and increased brain ala levels). pretreatment of rats with the mao inhibitor tranylcypromine prevented the increase in brain gaba and ala levels with plz, but did not block the effect of vig on gaba. these observations with tranylcypromine and plz support the hypothesis that an active metabolite of plz produced by the actions of mao on this drug plays a major role in its gaba- and ala-elevating actions.	tranylcypromine @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ tranylcypromine @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ tranylcypromine @chemical@ transaminases @gene@ @cpr:4@ phenelzine @chemical@ monoamine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ phenelzine @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ vigabatrin @chemical@ gaba transaminase @gene@ @cpr:4@ vigabatrin @chemical@ gaba-t @gene@ @cpr:4@ vig @chemical@ gaba transaminase @gene@ @cpr:4@ vig @chemical@ gaba-t @gene@ @cpr:4@ plz @chemical@ monoamine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ plz @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ plz @chemical@ gaba-t @gene@ @cpr:4@ vig @chemical@ gaba-t @gene@ @cpr:4@ plz @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ plz @chemical@ ala-t @gene@ @cpr:4@ phenelzine @chemical@ monoamine oxidase @gene@ @cpr:4@ vig @chemical@ gaba-t @gene@ @cpr:4@ vig @chemical@ mao @gene@ @cpr:4@ vig @chemical@ ala-t @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
steroid hormone synthesis in mitochondria. mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, p450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. this enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin d. the access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, star, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. star action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (omm). components of this machine include the 18kda translocator protein (tspo), the voltage-dependent anion chanel (vdac-1), tspo-associated protein 7 (pap7, acbd3), and protein kinase a regulatory subunit 1α (pkar1a). the precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the omm to p450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the omm, remain unclear. human deficiency diseases have been described for star and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.	cholesterol @chemical@ p450scc @gene@ @cpr:9@ cholesterol @chemical@ p450scc @gene@ @cpr:9@

alpha(1b) adrenergic receptors in gonadotrophin-releasing hormone neurones: relation to transport-p. 1. peptidergic neurones accumulate amines via an unusual uptake process, designated transport-p. [(3)h]-prazosin binds to alpha(1) adrenoceptors on these cells and is displaceable by unlabelled prazosin in concentrations up to 10(-7) m. however, at greater concentrations of prazosin, there is a paradoxical accumulation of [(3)h]-prazosin which we have attributed to transport-p. uptake of prazosin via transport-p is detectable at 10(-10) m prazosin concentration, is linear up to 10(-7) m and at greater concentrations becomes non-linear. in contrast, in noradrenergic neurones, noradrenaline uptake is linear and saturates above 10(-7) m. in noradrenergic neurones and in non-neuronal cells, there is no uptake of prazosin in concentrations up to 10(-6) m, suggesting that transport-p is a specialised function of peptidergic neurones. 2. using a mouse peptidergic (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, gnrh) neuronal cell line which possesses transport-p, we have studied the interaction of alpha(1) adrenoceptors with transport-p. polymerase chain reactions and dna sequencing of the products demonstrated that only the alpha(1b) sub-type of adrenoceptors is present in gnrh cells. 3. in cos cells transfected with alpha(1b) adrenoceptor cdna and in ddt(1) mf-2 cells which express native alpha(1b) adrenoceptors, [(3)h]-prazosin was displaced by unlabelled prazosin in a normal equilibrium process, with no prazosin paradox in concentrations up to 10(-6) m. in ddt(1) mf-2 cells, [(3)h]-prazosin was displaced likewise by a series of alpha(1) adrenergic agonists, none of which increased the binding of [(3)h]-prazosin. hence, the prazosin paradox is not due to some function of alpha(1) adrenoceptors, such as internalization of ligand-receptor complexes. 4. in neurones which possess transport-p, transfection with alpha(1b) adrenoceptor cdna resulted in over-expression of alpha(1b) adrenoceptors, but the prazosin paradox was unaltered. thus, alpha(1) adrenoceptors and transport-p mediate distinct functions in peptidergic neurones.	@norel@
a novel method for preparing complete antigens of gonyautoxin 2,3 and their feature of immunogenicity. in this paper, a novel method was proposed to prepare artificial antigens of gonyaulax parlaytic shellfish toxin 2 and 3 (gtx2,3). an intermediate gtx2,3-aldehyde was first synthesized by activating the nh2 group of the 2nd and 8th amino acid residues with three different aldehydes and two artificial complete antigens gtx2,3-aldehyde-bovine serum albumin (bsa) and gtx2,3-aldehyde- keyhole limpet hemocyanin (klh) were then prepared by cross-linking the intermediate with bsa or klh. the successful preparation of the two complete antigens was confirmed by uv spectral scanning, hplc, production of antibodies with titer of 1.28 × 10(4) from mice immunized with the two complete antigens, indirect elisa and western-blot. in conclusion, the synthesized complete antigens have strong immunogenicity, which provides a solid foundation for preparing gtx2,3 monoclonal antibody and rapid detection kit.	@norel@
addition of eicosapentaenoic acid to gamma-linolenic acid-supplemented diets prevents serum arachidonic acid accumulation in humans. previous studies reveal that supplementation of human diets with gamma-linolenic acid (gla) reduces the generation of lipid mediators of inflammation and attenuates clinical symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. however, we have shown that supplementation with this same fatty acid also causes a marked increase in serum arachidonate (aa) levels, a potentially harmful side effect. the objective of this study was to design a supplementation strategy that maintained the capacity of gla to reduce lipid mediators without causing elevations in serum aa levels. initial in vitro studies utilizing hep-g2 liver cells revealed that addition of eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) blocked delta-5-desaturase activity, the terminal enzymatic step in aa synthesis. to test the in vivo effects of a gla and epa combination in humans, adult volunteers consuming controlled diets supplemented these diets with 3.0 g/d of gla and epa. this supplementation strategy significantly increased serum levels of epa, but did not increase aa levels. epa and the elongation product of gla, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (dgla) levels in neutrophil glycerolipids increased significantly during the 3-wk supplementation period. neutrophils isolated from volunteers fed diets supplemented with gla and epa released similar quantities of aa, but synthesized significantly lower quantities of leukotrienes compared with their neutrophils before supplementation. this study revealed that a gla and epa supplement combination may be utilized to reduce the synthesis of proinflammatory aa metabolites, and importantly, not induce potentially harmful increases in serum aa levels.	eicosapentaenoic acid @chemical@ delta-5-desaturase @gene@ @cpr:4@ epa @chemical@ delta-5-desaturase @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
dna polymerase minor groove interactions modulate mutagenic bypass of a templating 8-oxoguanine lesion. a major base lesion resulting from oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxog) that has ambiguous coding potential. error-free dna synthesis involves 8-oxog adopting an anti-conformation to base pair with cytosine whereas mutagenic bypass involves 8-oxog adopting a syn-conformation to base pair with adenine. left unrepaired the syn-8-oxog/damp base pair results in a g-c to t-a transversion. during base excision repair of this mispair, dna polymerase (pol) β is confronted with gap filling opposite 8-oxog. to determine how pol β discriminates between anti- and syn-8-oxog, we introduced a point mutation (r283k) to alter insertion specificity. kinetic studies demonstrate that this substitution results in an increased fidelity opposite 8-oxog. structural studies with r283k pol β show that the binary dna complex has 8-oxog in equilibrium between anti- and syn-forms. ternary complexes with incoming dctp resemble the wild-type enzyme, with templating anti-8-oxog base pairing with incoming cytosine. in contrast to wild-type pol β, the ternary complex of the r283k mutant with an incoming datp-analogue and templating 8-oxog resembles a g-a mismatched structure with 8-oxog adopting an anti-conformation. these results demonstrate that the incoming nucleotide is unable to induce a syn-8-oxog conformation without minor groove dna polymerase interactions that influence templating (anti-/syn-equilibrium) of 8-oxog while modulating fidelity.	@norel@
interactions between cyp2e1 and cyp2b4: effects on affinity for nadph-cytochrome p450 reductase and substrate metabolism. studies in microsomal and reconstituted systems have shown that the presence of one cytochrome p450 isoform can significantly influence the catalytic activity of another isoform. in this study, we assessed whether cyp2e1 could influence the catalytic activity of cyp2b4 under steady-state turnover conditions. the results show that cyp2e1 inhibits cyp2b4-mediated metabolism of benzphetamine (bnz) with a k(i) of 0.04 µm. however, cyp2b4 is not an inhibitor of cyp2e1-mediated p-nitrophenol hydroxylation. when these inhibition studies were performed with the artificial oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cyp2e1 did not significantly inhibit cyp2b4 activity. determinations of the apparent k(m) and k(cat) of cyp2b4 for cpr in the presence of increasing concentrations of cyp2e1 revealed a mixed inhibition of cyp2b4 by cyp2e1. at low concentrations of cyp2e1, the apparent k(m) of cyp2b4 for cpr increased up to 23-fold with virtually no change in the k(cat) for the reaction, however, at higher concentrations of cyp2e1, the apparent k(m) of cyp2b4 for cpr decreased to levels similar to those observed in the absence of cyp2e1 and the k(cat) also decreased by 11-fold. additionally, cyp2e1 increased the apparent k(m) of cyp2b4 for bnz by 8-fold and the apparent k(m) did not decrease to its original value when saturating concentrations of cpr were used. while the individual apparent k(m) values of cyp2b4 and cyp2e1 for cpr are similar, the apparent k(m) of cyp2e1 for cpr in the presence of cyp2b4 decreased significantly, thus suggesting that cyp2b4 enhances the affinity of cyp2e1 for cpr and this may allow cyp2e1 to out-compete cyp2b4 for cpr.	benzphetamine @chemical@ cyp2b4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ bnz @chemical@ cyp2b4 @gene@ @cpr:9@ p-nitrophenol @chemical@ cyp2e1 @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
mouse brain serine racemase catalyzes specific elimination of l-serine to pyruvate. d-serine was previously identified in mammalian brain and was shown to be a co-agonist at the 'glycine' site of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-type receptors. racemization of serine is catalyzed by serine racemase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme expressed mainly in brain and liver. nmda receptor overactivation has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions and inhibitors of serine racemase are thus potentially interesting targets for therapy. we expressed recombinant mouse serine racemase in insect cells and purified it to near homogeneity. the enzyme is a non-covalent homodimer in solution and requires divalent cations mg(2+), ca(2+) or mn(2+) for activity but not for dimerization. in addition to the racemization it also catalyzes specific elimination of l-ser to pyruvate. d-serine is eliminated much less efficiently. both l-serine racemization and elimination activities of serine racemase are of comparable magnitude, display alkaline ph optimum and are negligible below ph 6.5.	d-serine @chemical@ n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-type receptors @gene@ @cpr:5@ pyruvate @chemical@ mouse brain serine racemase @gene@ @cpr:9@ l-serine @chemical@ mouse brain serine racemase @gene@ @cpr:9@ serine @chemical@ serine racemase @gene@ @cpr:9@ 
incorporation of trifluoroisoleucine into proteins in vivo. two fluorinated derivatives of isoleucine: d,l-2-amino-3-trifluoromethyl pentanoic acid (3tfi, 2) and d,l-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoro-3-methyl pentanoic acid (5tfi, 3) were prepared. 5tfi was incorporated into a model target protein, murine dihydrofolate reductase (mdhfr), in an isoleucine auxotrophic escherichia coli host strain suspended in 5tfi-supplemented minimal medium depleted of isoleucine. incorporation of 5tfi was confirmed by tryptic peptide analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) of the protein product. amino acid analysis showed that more than 93% of the encoded isoleucine residues were replaced by 5tfi. measurement of the rate of activation of 5tfi by the e. coli isoleucyl-trna synthetase (ilers) yielded a specificity constant (k(cat)/k(m)) 134-fold lower than that for isoleucine. 5tfi was successfully introduced into the cytokine murine interleukin-2 (mil-2) at the encoded isoleucine positions. the concentration of fluorinated protein that elicits 50% of the maximal proliferative response is 3.87 ng/ml, about 30% higher than that of wild-type mil-2 (ec(50) = 2.70 ng/ml). the maximal responses are equivalent for the fluorinated and wild-type cytokines, indicating that fluorinated proteins can fold into stable and functional structures. 3tfi yielded no evidence for in vivo incorporation into recombinant proteins, and no evidence for activation by ilers in vitro.	@norel@
quercetin reduces high-fat diet-induced fat accumulation in the liver by regulating lipid metabolism genes. to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of quercetin on the physiological effects of hyperlipidemia, we investigated its role in the prevention of high-fat diet (hfd)-induced obesity and found that it regulated hepatic gene expression related to lipid metabolism. quercetin supplementation in mice significantly reduced the hfd-induced gains in body weight, liver weight, and white adipose tissue weight compared with the mice fed only with hfd. it also significantly reduced hfd-induced increases in serum lipids, including cholesterol, triglyceride, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (tbars). consistent with the reduced liver weight and white adipose tissue weight, hepatic lipid accumulation and the size of lipid droplets in the epididymal fat pads were also reduced by quercetin supplementation. to further investigate how quercetin may reduce obesity, we analyzed lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver. quercetin supplementation altered expression profiles of several lipid metabolism-related genes, including fnta, pon1, pparg, aldh1b1, apoa4, abcg5, gpam, acaca, cd36, fdft1, and fasn, relative to those in hfd control mice. the expression patterns of these genes observed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were confirmed by immunoblot assays. collectively, our results indicate that quercetin prevents hfd-induced obesity in c57b1/6 mice, and its anti-obesity effects may be related to the regulation of lipogenesis at the level of transcription.	@norel@
re-evaluation of lisuride pharmacology: 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptor-mediated behavioral effects overlap its other properties in rats. rationale: there is substantial evidence that lisuride can produce effects linked to 5-ht(1a) receptor occupancy. nevertheless, this action has generally been ignored in the mechanism of action of lisuride, in favor of an exclusive role for dopamine receptors in considering its antiparkinsonian effects, or an exclusive role of 5-ht(2a/2c) receptor activation in hallucinogenesis. these conclusions are surprising when one considers that the potent interaction of lisuride with 5-ht(1a) receptors has been demonstrated in several different laboratories and that activation of 5-ht(1a) and 5-ht(1b) receptors can modulate dopaminergically mediated responses. objective: the lack of full substitution of lisuride for lysergic acid diethylamide (lsd) in drug discrimination experiments and induction of a pronounced 5-ht syndrome by this compound at relatively low doses convinced us to execute two series of experiments that might explain the primary mechanism responsible for lisuride-mediated biological effects and its paradoxical classification as a dopamine agonist in the literature. results: in drug discrimination studies, lisuride fully mimicked the 5-ht(1a) agonist ly 293284, only partially substituted for lsd and doi, and failed to substitute for (+)-amphetamine. lisuride produced a significant dose-related increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and lower-lip retraction which reflect a modulation of behavior by action at central 5-ht(1a) receptors. only pmppi [4-iodo-n-[2-[4-(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-2-pyridynyl-benzamide hydrochloride], a selective 5-ht(1a) antagonist, was effective in inhibiting all 5-ht syndrome behaviors produced by lisuride, whereas pmppi was without effect on any behavior induced by lsd. lisuride dose dependently decreased body temperature in rats with a potency similar to that of the selective 5-ht(1a) agonist ly 293284. the hypothermic effect of lisuride was prevented by pre-injection of pmppi, but not by ketanserin or haloperidol. conclusion: we have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of low doses of lisuride are clearly mediated by stimulation of 5-ht(1a) receptors.	ly 293284 @chemical@ 5-ht(1a) @gene@ @cpr:5@ lisuride @chemical@ 5-ht(1a) @gene@ @cpr:5@ ly 293284 @chemical@ 5-ht(1a) @gene@ @cpr:5@ 4-iodo-n-[2-[4-(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-2-pyridynyl-benzamide hydrochloride @chemical@ 5-ht(1a) @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
anxiolytic- but not antidepressant-like activity of lu af21934, a novel, selective positive allosteric modulator of the mglu₄ receptor. previous studies demonstrated that the group iii mglu receptor-selective orthosteric agonist, lsp1-2111 produced anxiolytic- but not antidepressant-like effects upon peripheral administration. herein, we report the pharmacological actions of lu af21934, a novel, selective, and brain-penetrant positive allosteric modulator (pam) of the mglu(4) receptor in the stress-induced hyperthermia (sih), four-plate, marble-burying and vogel's conflict tests. in all models, except vogel's conflict test, a dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effect was seen. the anti-hyperthermic effect of lu af21934 (5 mg/kg) in the sih test was inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg) and was not serotonin-dependent, as it persisted in serotonin-deficient mice and upon blockade of either 5-ht(1a) receptors by way100635, or 5-ht(2a/2c) receptors by ritanserin. these results suggest that the gabaergic system, but not the serotonergic system, is involved in the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like phenotype of lu af21934 in rodents. lu af21934 did not produce antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test (tst) in mice; however, it decreased the basal locomotor activity of mice that were not habituated to activity cages. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'metabotropic glutamate receptors'.	way100635 @chemical@ 5-ht(1a) @gene@ @cpr:4@ ritanserin @chemical@ 5-ht(2a/2c) @gene@ @cpr:4@ lsp1-2111 @chemical@ group iii mglu receptor @gene@ @cpr:5@ flumazenil @chemical@ benzodiazepine receptor @gene@ @cpr:6@ 
apoptosis initiation of β-ionone in sgc-7901 gastric carcinoma cancer cells via a pi3k-akt pathway. β-ionone has been shown to hold potent anti-proliferative and apoptosis induction properties in vitro and in vivo. to investigate the effects of β-ionone on apoptosis initiation and its possible mechanisms of action, we qualified cell apoptosis, proteins related to apoptosis and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)-akt pathway in human gastric adenocarcinoma cancer sgc-7901 cells. the results demonstrated that β-ionone-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in sgc-7901 cells treated with β-ionone (25, 50, 100 and 200 μmol/l) for 24 h. β-ionone was also shown to induce the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and inhibit bcl-2 expression in sgc-7901 cells in a dose-dependent manner. the significantly decreased levels of p-pi3k and p-akt expression were observed in sgc-7901 cells after β-ionone treatments in a time- and dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). thus, the apoptosis induction in sgc-7901 cells by β-ionone may be regulated through a pi3k-akt pathway. these results demonstrate a potential mechanism by which β-ionone to induce apoptosis initiation in sgc-7901 cells.	β-ionone @chemical@ caspase-3 @gene@ @cpr:3@ β-ionone @chemical@ bcl-2 @gene@ @cpr:4@ β-ionone @chemical@ p-pi3k @gene@ @cpr:4@ β-ionone @chemical@ p-akt @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
the antipsychotic drugs sertindole and pimozide block erg3, a human brain k(+) channel. the antipsychotic drugs sertindole and pimozide are known to prolong the qt interval on the electrocardiogram via a high affinity block of the cardiac k(+) channel known as herg (human ether-a-go-go-related gene; erg1). we wished to test whether these drugs also displayed high affinity for the related neuronal k(+) channel erg3. the cdna encoding erg3 channel was cloned from a human brain library. northern analysis confirmed that the channel was localized to brain relative to other tissues including heart, liver and lung. within the brain, erg3 was expressed in higher amounts in the frontal lobe and cerebellum relative to the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. transient expression of erg3 in chinese hamster ovary cells produced outwardly directed k(+) currents that activated at approximately -50 mv and produced a large transient component at positive membrane potentials. inward tail currents measured at -100 mv were blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by sertindole resulting in an ic(50) value of 43 nm. significant inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 3 nm. block of erg3 by sertindole also displayed a positive voltage-dependence. pimozide blocked erg3 channel currents with an ic(50) of 103 nm and significant inhibition was noted at concentrations of 10 nm and higher. we conclude that erg3 can be blocked by certain antipsychotic drugs like sertindole and pimozide. inhibition of erg3 or related k(+) channels in the brain may contribute to the efficacy/side effect profiles of some antipsychotic drugs.	sertindole @chemical@ erg3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sertindole @chemical@ human brain k(+) channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ erg3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ human brain k(+) channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ sertindole @chemical@ erg3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ erg3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sertindole @chemical@ erg3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ erg3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ sertindole @chemical@ cardiac k(+) channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ sertindole @chemical@ herg @gene@ @cpr:4@ sertindole @chemical@ human ether-a-go-go-related gene @gene@ @cpr:4@ sertindole @chemical@ erg1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ cardiac k(+) channel @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ herg @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ human ether-a-go-go-related gene @gene@ @cpr:4@ pimozide @chemical@ erg1 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
evaluation of biological activities of a groundnut (apios americana medik) extract containing a novel isoflavone. groundnut (apios americana medik) contains a novel isoflavone, genistein-7-o-gentiobioside. in the present study, we examined the biological activities of an alcohol extract of groundnut containing genistein-7-o-gentiobioside as the main component. although the groundnut extract by itself did not show antioxidative activity, it drove the antioxidative system in cells. pretreatment of human breast carcinoma mcf-7 cells for 24 h with the groundnut extract and soybean isoflavone increased gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1), a major antioxidative stress enzyme. these groundnut extract-treated cells showed antioxidative activity against free radicals derived from a radical initiator. pretreatment of cells with 100 μg/ml groundnut extract prevented the depletion of glutathione by the radical initiator; however, treatment with 100 μg/ml of soybean isoflavone injured the cell membrane, indicating that glutathione might be released to the extracellular environment. these results suggest that the groundnut extract had isoflavone-like activity. like soybean, groundnuts are a good source of isoflavones.	isoflavone @chemical@ heme oxygenase-1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ isoflavone @chemical@ ho-1 @gene@ @cpr:3@ 
alpha-2b adrenergic receptor mediated hemodynamic profile of etomidate. etomidate has been used since 1972 as an inductor and in maintaining anesthesia. there are multiple mechanisms that account for the biologic effects of etomidate. one of the most prominent features of this drug is that it provides anesthesia without gross changes in hemodynamic parameters. this feature allows using etomidate in patients with considerable cardiopulmonary compromise avoiding the characteristic hypotension produced by other anesthetics. the mechanism that provides the basis for its cardiovascular stability is the capacity to bind and stimulate peripheral alpha-2b adrenergic receptors with a subsequent vasoconstriction. alterations in the function or number of these receptors may account for abnormal responses during etomidate induction.	@norel@
interleukin 2 toxin: a step toward selective immunomodulation. we have used protein engineering and recombinant dna methodologies to genetically replace the eukaryotic cell receptor binding domain of diphtheria toxin with interleukin 2 (il-2). the toxin-related t cell growth factor fusion gene has been cloned in escherichia coli k12. recombinant strains of e coli produce a 68,086 k hybrid toxin, il-2 toxin that retains immunologic properties intrinsic to both its diphtheria toxin and il-2 components. il-2 toxin has been found to selectively inhibit protein synthesis in both human and murine t cell lines that bear high affinity il-2 receptors, whereas the hybrid toxin is not active against cells that do not bear this receptor. the cytotoxic action of il-2 toxin is specifically blocked by free il-2 and monoclonal antibodies that bind to the p55 (tac antigen) subunit of the high affinity il-2 receptor. in addition, il-2 toxin, like diphtheria toxin itself, must pass through an acidic compartment in order to deliver its adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase activity to the cytosol of target t cells. in a murine delayed type hypersensitivity (dth) model system, we have shown that il-2 toxin treatment induces a marked immunosuppression.	@norel@
substrate specificity of the human renal sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter, hnadc-3, under voltage-clamp conditions. proximal tubule cells extract dicarboxylates from filtrate and blood, using cotransporters located in the brush border [sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter (nadc-1)] and basolateral cell membrane (nadc-3). we expressed the human nadc-3 (hnadc-3) in xenopus laevis oocytes and characterized it by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. at -60 mv, succinate (4 carbons) and glutarate (5 carbons) generated inward currents due to translocation of three sodium ions and one divalent dicarboxylate, whereas oxalate (2 carbons) and malonate (3 carbons) did not. the cis-dicarboxylate maleate produced currents smaller in magnitude, whereas the trans-dicarboxylate fumarate generated currents similar to succinate. the substituted succinate derivatives, malate, 2,2- and 2,3-dimethylsuccinate, and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate elicited inward currents, whereas aspartate and guanidinosuccinate showed hardly detectable currents. the c-5 dicarboxylates glutarate and alpha-ketoglutarate produced larger currents than succinate; glutamate and folate failed to cause inward currents. kinetic analysis revealed, at -60 mv, k(0.5) values of 25 +/- 12 microm for succinate and 45 +/- 13 microm for alpha-ketoglutarate, values close to the plasma concentration of these compounds. for both compounds, the k(0.5) was independent of voltage, whereas the maximal current increased with hyperpolarization. as opposed to the rat and flounder orthologs, hnadc-3 was hardly inhibited by lithium concentrations up to 5 mm. in the absence of sodium, however, lithium can mediate succinate-dependent currents. the narrow substrate specificity prevents interaction of drugs with dicarboxylate-like structure with hnadc-3 and ensures sufficient support of the proximal tubule cells with alpha-ketoglutarate for anion secretion via organic anion transporter 1 or 3.	lithium @chemical@ hnadc-3 @gene@ @cpr:4@ 
quantitative determination of fatty acid chain composition in pork meat products by high resolution 1h nmr spectroscopy. high resolution (1)h nmr spectroscopy was proposed for the determination of the fatty acid chain profile of lipids in pork meat products during ripening. two typical mediterranean pdo salami produced in calabria, a region in the southern italy, were chosen as a case of study. quantitative nmr analysis provided the fatty acid chain profiles of total lipid extracts. the transesterification of total lipid extracts furnished fame mixtures that enabled quantitation of fatty acid acyl chains in the acylglycerol and ffa portions. in all cases, oleyl chains were predominant, and high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid chains were observed. the proposed spectroscopic method allowed also the estimation of the most important nutritional parameters of dry fermented meat products.	@norel@
impaired local production of pro-resolving lipid mediators in obesity and 17-hdha as a potential treatment for obesity-associated inflammation. obesity-induced chronic low-grade inflammation originates from adipose tissue and is crucial for obesity-driven metabolic deterioration including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.chronic inflammation may be a consequence of a failure to actively resolve inflammation,and could result from a lack of local specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (spm) such as resolvins and protectins, which derive from the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha). we assessed obesity-induced changes of n-3-derived spm in adipose tissue and effects of dietary epa/dha thereon.moreover, we treated obese mice with spm precursors and investigated effects on inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. obesity significantly decreased dha-derived 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-hdha, resolvin d1 precursor) and protectin d1 levels in murine adipose tissue. dietary epa/dha treatment restored endogenous biosynthesis of n-3 derived lipid mediators in obesity while attenuating adipose tissue inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity. notably, 17-hdha treatment reduced adipose tissue expression of inflammatory cytokines, increased adiponectin expression and improved glucose tolerance parallel to insulin sensitivity in obese mice. these findings indicate that impaired biosynthesis of certain spm and spm precursors including 17-hdha and protectin d1 contributes to adipose tissue inflammation in obesity and suggest 17-hdha as a novel treatment option for obesity-associated complications.	epa @chemical@ insulin @gene@ @cpr:3@ 17-hdha @chemical@ adiponectin @gene@ @cpr:3@ 17-hdha @chemical@ insulin @gene@ @cpr:3@ dha @chemical@ insulin @gene@ @cpr:3@ 17-hdha @chemical@ cytokines @gene@ @cpr:4@
