{"Rasmussen-Encephalitis": {"abstract": "consider the abstract: $ rasmussen encephalitis, sometimes referred to as rasmussen syndrome, is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by chronic progressive inflammation (encephalitis) of one cerebral hemisphere. as a result, the patient usually experiences frequent episodes of uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that cause epileptic seizures (epilepsy), and progressive cerebral destruction. with time, further symptoms may include progressive weakness of one side of the body (hemiparesis), language problems (if on the left side of the brain) and intellectual disabilities. the exact cause of this disorder is not known. the two leading ideas are that the brain inflammation might be a reaction of a foreign antigen (infection) or an autoimmune disease limited to one side of the brain resulting in brain damage. it occurs mostly, but not always, in children between the ages of two and ten years, and in many patients the course of the disease is most severe during the first 8 to 12 months. after the peak inflammatory response is reached, the progression of this disorder appears to slow or stop and the patient is left with permanent neurological deficits. rasmussen encephalitis mostly affects children ten years of age and younger. it is unusual to affect children under two years of age. adolescents and young adults in much smaller proportions are also affected. there may be a history of some prior mild cold or flu prior to the onset of the seizures. the annual number of new-onset rasmussen has been estimated as 2.4/10,000,000 persons less than or equal to 18 years of age. $ from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them.", "triples": [{"rel": "produces", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "sign encephalitis"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "sign epilepsy"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "sign progressive cerebral destruction"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "sign hemiparesis"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "sign language problems"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "sign intellectual disabilities"}, {"rel": "anaphora", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "anaphor \"this disorder\""}, {"rel": "anaphora", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "anaphor \"it\""}, {"rel": "is_synon", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen syndrome", "arg2": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "anaphor \"this disorder\"", "arg2": "sign brain inflammation"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "anaphor \"this disorder\"", "arg2": "sign brain damage"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "anaphor \"this disorder\"", "arg2": "sign permanent neurological deficits"}, {"rel": "anaphora", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "anaphor \"the disease\""}, {"rel": "anaphora", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "anaphor \"this disorder\""}, {"rel": "anaphora", "arg1": "raredisease rasmussen encephalitis", "arg2": "anaphor \"it\""}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "anaphor \"it\"", "arg2": "sign seizures"}], "pmid": "Rasmussen-Encephalitis"}, "Crouzon-Syndrome": {"abstract": "consider the abstract: $ crouzon syndrome affects males and females. some articles in the medical literature report that males are affected more often than females. crouzon syndrome is estimated to affect about 1.6 in 100,000 people in the general population. all forms of craniosynostosis are estimated to affect about 1 in 2,000-2,5000 live births. $ from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them.", "triples": [{"rel": "no relation"}], "pmid": "Crouzon-Syndrome"}, "Cronkhite": {"abstract": "consider the abstract: $ cronkhite-canada syndrome (ccs) is an extremely rare disease characterized by various intestinal polyps, loss of taste, hair loss, and nail growth problems. it is difficult to treat because of malabsorption that accompanies the polyps. ccs occurs primarily in the older population (average age 59) and predominantly occurs in males. it is considered to be an acquired, not hereditary, disease. the exact cause of cronkhite-canada syndrome is unknown. it seems to occur for no known reason (sporadically) and is not thought to be hereditary. cronkhite-canada syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males predominantly.

liver disorder that tends to affect people of middle eastern jewish heritage disproportionately to other groups. it appears to be associated with clotting factor vii in this population. symptoms may include a yellowish color to the skin (jaundice), and a liver that is sometimes enlarged and tender. jaundice, which is caused by excess bilirubin (bile pigment), is usually the only symptom of dubin johnson syndrome.  otherwise a physical examination is normal.  the disorder rarely appears before puberty.  occasionally the patient may have an enlarged and tender liver and complain of weakness and a painful abdomen, but the liver will function normally. there may sometimes be a mild recurrence of the jaundice. pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives may cause the disease to become apparent in women when no symptoms appeared previously. dubin johnson syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  in recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  if an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  the risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  the risk is the same for each pregnancy. dubin johnson syndrome is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  the disorder can occur in all races.  however, among iranian, iraqi and moroccan jews the incidence is as high as 1 in 1300.  in japan an unusually high incidence of dubin-johnson syndrome was found in an isolated area where there was a high rate of intermarriage.  age at onset can be anytime between 10 weeks of age to 56 years. treatment of dubin johnson syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. in many cases patients may require no treatment even though they have recurrent mild jaundice. however, metabolism of certain drugs may be affected in patients with dubin-johnson syndrome since many pharmaceutical products are metabolized in the liver. therefore, medications should be carefully supervised by a physician. genetic counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families affected by dubin johnson syndrome. $ from the given

of carcinoid tumors remains unclear. some studies have suggested risk factors such as smoking and dietary intake, however, further research is needed to confirm these findings. in the majority of cases tumors are slow-growing and can produce hormonal chemical substances such as serotonin, bradykinins, tachykinins and prostaglandins. if the original carcinoid cells spread (metastasize) to the liver, these substances are no longer broken down to their inactive form and are released into the systemic (main) circulation, causing the signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. when tumors affect organs other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as the ovaries, carcinoid syndrome can occur in the absence of liver metastases. carcinoid tumors are rare, with only 27 new cases per million diagnosed in the u.s. per year. of these, only about 10% will develop carcinoid syndrome. the syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. all races can be affected though there is a slightly increased prevalence in black african males. all ages can be affected but most gastrointestinal cases occur in middle-age. bronchial (airway) tumors are most often seen in the fifth decade but can affect people at any age. carcinoid syndrome may be more prevalent than suspected because diagnosis is difficult and sometimes overlooked; some patients may not exhibit all three of the hallmark symptoms of flushing, wheezing, and diarrhea. diagnosis is best achieved with a multimodality approach including biochemical investigation, radiological and nuclear imaging, and finally histological (tissue biopsy) confirmation where possible. the occurrence of episodic facial flushing and/or chronic diarrhea not diagnosed by standard tests as being a result of more common causes should lead to suspicion of carcinoid syndrome. in the past, measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyendolacetic acid (5-hiaa), a product of the breakdown (metabolism) of serotonin, in a patient on a low serotonin diet was the main lab test used. it is still useful and the level of 5-hiaa will be clearly elevated in 50% of the cases. however, there are also blood tests available, the most useful being chromogranin-a, often in combination with an imaging technique known as octreoscan, that may confirm the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome even when urinary 5-hiaa is normal. this technique may also be helpful in indicating the presence of carcinoid tumors when the full spectrum of symptoms is not apparent. other investigations that may be helpful, depending on the location of the primary tumor, include ct scan, ultrasound, mri and endoscopy. sometimes the diagnosis is established incidentally at the time of surgery for another suspected condition such as intestinal obstruction or appendicitis. $ from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them.", "triples": [{"rel": "produces", "arg1": "raredisease carcinoid syndrome", "arg2": "sign carcinoid tumors"},

blood (renal arteries) and the arteries called the carotid and vertebral arteries which are found in the neck and supply the brain with blood. less commonly, fmd affects the arteries in the abdomen (supplying the liver, spleen and intestines) and extremities (legs and arms). in more than one-half of people with this disease, there will be evidence of fmd in more than one artery. fmd affects women far more commonly than men, although men and children can be affected with this disease. in children with fmd, the disease seems to more commonly present with significant narrowing rather than tears of arteries and also seems to involve the arteries to the kidneys and intestines more commonly than the carotid vessels. in the pediatric population, fmd affects both boys and girls. the vascular subtype of ehlers-danlos syndrome (type iv) has been associated with the most common type of fibromuscular dysplasia, known as multifocal fmd. this syndrome should be suspected in patients

imaging the arteries, including specialized blood vessel ultrasound known as duplex ultrasound; a cat scan of the arteries which is obtained after a dye is given through the veins, or a special type of mri. in many cases, the diagnosis of fmd requires that a procedure known as an arteriogram be performed. arteriography is a procedure that is performed by a radiologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, or vascular medicine specialist with appropriate training. it involves inserting a wire into or near the affected artery and injecting contrast material, a dye that can be detected by an x-ray machine. an x-ray of the affected area is then taken and examined. the individual is usually awake during an arteriogram procedure although medications may be given to keep her or him

(pharynx). this infection can usually be controlled and/or cured with timely treatment. the disease has three phases: acute, latent, and chronic.  the acute phase begins approximately four days after infection and can last for two to four months.  symptoms during this phase include fever, abdominal pain with tender liver, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hives (urticaria) accompanied by bouts of bronchial asthma.  the latent phase begins when mature flukes reach the bile duct and can last for several months.  individuals in this phase are asymptomatic.  the chronic phase can persist for several years.  symptoms include gastrointestinal pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, itching, and abdominal tenderness. fascioliasis is caused by infection with the parasitic worms of the genus fasciola, of which \"fasciola hepatica\", found in temperate climates, and \"fasciola gigantica\", found in tropical climates, are the most common.  encysted parasitic larvae of these parasites live on water plants, such as watercress, that may be eaten by man or eaten by animals that subsequently are eaten by man.  once ingested, the larvae escape from the cysts in the small intestine and migrate across the intestinal wall into the abdominal cavity.  they transform into immature worms and, once they reach the liver, move around for up to six weeks, feeding on liver tissue.  eventually, they take up residence in the bile ducts, where they cause lesions and chronic liver disease.  generally, the parasite can be killed by adequate cooking of foods before they are eaten. liver fluke disease should be suspected if the patient recently spent time in a region where infection is prevalent in animals and/or humans. patients usually report eating wild watercress, algae, or other

pucker. in most cases, the ring and pinky (fourth and fifth) fingers are most affected. in addition, the disorder usually affects both hands (bilateral). although the exact cause of dupuytren's

and an unusually pronounced philtrum, which is the vertical groove in the center of the upper lip. most new cases of hiv infection in young children (pediatric hiv infection) are caused by transmission from the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding (perinatal transmission).  estimates suggest that the transmission rate from untreated hiv-positive mothers in the

however, such testing is not conclusive in children younger than 18 months. in these children, hiv infection may be confirmed through the repeated use of various specialized viral detection laboratory tests (e.g., hiv viral cultures, a dna-amplification and copying method known as polymerase chain reaction [pcr]). additional laboratory tests may also be conducted to assess immune functioning in order to assist in diagnosis and to monitor disease progression and its treatment. testing may include monitoring of helper t cell numbers (cd4+ cells), the ratio of helper t cells to certain other white blood cells (cd8+ cells), complete blood counts, and blood platelet levels.\" $ from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them.", "triples": [{"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "raredisease pediatric hiv infection"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "disease hiv"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "disease hiv"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "raredisease perinatal hiv infection"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "symptom immunodeficiency"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "sign flattened nasal bridge"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "sign pronounced philtrum"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "disease hiv"}, {"rel": "produces", "arg1": "sign large, wide eyes", "arg2": "disease hiv"}, {"rel": "is_synon", "arg1": "raredisease hiv embryopathy", "arg2": "sign large, wide eyes"}, {"rel": "is_synon", "arg1": "raredisease pediatric hiv infection", "arg2": "raredisease hiv infection in young children"}], "pmid": "AIDS-Dysmorphic-Syndrome"}, "Myopathy-Scapuloperoneal": {"abstract": "consider the abstract: $ scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting of certain muscles. symptoms are usually limited to the shoulder blade area (scapula) and the smaller of the two leg muscle groups below the knee (peroneal). facial muscles may be affected in a few cases. the leg symptoms often appear before the shoulder muscles become weakened. the rate of progression of the disorder varies from case to case. this condition can also occur in combination with other disorders. scapuloperoneal myopathy is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. scapuloperoneal myopathy affects males and females in equal numbers. symptoms may begin in childhood or during adulthood. scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare disorder;

solid foods, and/or some medications) is introduced into the diet. symptoms are variable among affected individuals but usually include watery diarrhea, abdominal swelling (distension) and/or

inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. csid is a metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and is diagnosed in approximately 0.2 percent of north americans. this disorder has a higher frequency among greenland and canadian inuit populations, with a reported incidence of approximately 10 percent. in addition, researchers report a higher degree of homozygosity among these more frequently affected groups than among other groups. also, as a diagnosis may be easily missed, especially in those individuals with mild symptoms, many researchers suspect there may be a higher incidence of this disorder than is actually reported in the medical literature. $ from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them.", "triples": [{"rel": "is_a",

to go through puberty reflects a hormonal imbalance that is caused by a failure of a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. patients with kallmann syndrome show evidence of small genitalia, sterile gonads that cannot produce the sex cells (hypogonadism), and a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). the impaired production of hormones as well as sperm and egg cells causes delayed puberty, growth and infertility.

liver abnormalities include an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), increased pressure in the venous system that carries blood from different organs to the liver (portal hypertension), and fiber-like connective tissue that spreads over and through the liver (hepatic fibrosis). gastrointestinal (stomach and intestine) bleeding, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) and hypersplenism (decreased platelet and other blood counts due to enlarged spleen) may be early signs of this condition. the frequency of chf is not known. the prevalence has been estimated to be 1/10,000 -20,000 based on the prevalence of ciliopathies that are associated with chf. chf is diagnosed by ultrasound exam and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and kidneys, and rarely, by liver biopsy. chf and caroli's syndrome are often associated with cystic disease of the kidneys. family history, physical exam, and various tests including kidney ultrasound exam, kidney function tests, x-rays, eye exam, brain mri, and molecular genetic testing can help to determine the underlying fcd syndrome. $ from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them.", "triples": [{"rel": "is_acron", "arg1":

"consider the abstract: $ cold antibody hemolytic anemia (caha) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (rbcs) by the body's natural defenses against invading organisms (antibodies). normally, the red blood cells have a life span of approximately 120 days before they are destroyed by the spleen. in individuals with caha, the red blood cells are destroyed prematurely and the rate of production of new cells in the bone marrow can no longer compensate for their loss. the severity of the anemia is determined by the length of time that the red blood cells survive and by the rate at which the bone marrow continues to create new red blood cell production. although cold antibody hemolytic anemia is known to be an autoimmune disorder, neither its exact underlying cause nor the process by which the disorder becomes apparent is fully understood.  autoimmune disorders occur when the body's natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue for unknown reasons. cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects older people.  the incidence of caha in the general population is about 1 in 80,000.  there appears to be a slight bias in favor of females in the incidence of caha, with a male to female ratio of 2 to 3.  those individuals with infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, or mycoplasma pneumonia are more susceptible to this disorder. in order to differentiate hemolytic anemia from the other anemias, doctors examine the patient's blood to determine the proportion of immature red blood cells, since the number of young cells is increased in hemolytic anemia. the patient is also examined to check for spleen or liver enlargement. an antiglobulin test (coomb's reaction) may be performed as the initial screening exam to detect the presence of immunoglobulin or complement on the red-cell membrane and to determine the specific class of immunoglobulin or complement present. in the case of cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the coomb's test is almost always positive for immunoglobulin m (igm). $ from the given abstract,

worms can be safely removed from the skin. dracunculosis is characterized by chronic skin ulcers.  tissue under the skin is infiltrated by developing larvae of the parasitic worm known as dracunculus medinensis, or guinea worm.  a female worm ready to release larvae produces stinging elevated spots (papules), causing redness and itching of the skin.  these symptoms may be an allergic reaction to the parasite.  the spots form blisters and later rupture, developing into painful ulcers.  multiple ulcers (usually on the legs) are common.  without treatment, the worms are absorbed or protrude from the skin over a period of several weeks. the cause of dracunculosis is the consumption of water contaminated by the larvae of the parasitic worm dracunculus medinensis, which live in an intermediate host in the water.  the larvae are released from the intermediate host while in the stomach, where they mate and grow.  this stage lasts for as long as a year.  the female apparently survives this process and may grow to three feet in length.  the symptoms and characteristic ulcers and infections occur when the female moves from the stomach or intestine to tissues under the skin. in 1986, there

of the disease has significantly decreased.  according to current estimates, there are now fewer than 100,000 cases of dracunculosis worldwide, with the remaining cases primarily occurring in sudan and certain countries in west africa, such as nigeria and niger. in individuals with dracunculosis, the condition is diagnosed based upon characteristic symptoms (e.g., fever, pain, and blistering and

continuum of sexual development in girls from uncomplicated premature thelarche to true precocious puberty; the former being more likely to develop in girls under 2 years of age. this spectrum exists

patients are initially thought to have gerd, but eoe patients do not typically respond to anti-gerd therapy and can be found not to have gerd upon diagnostic workup. recently, it has been appreciated that some patients with pronounced esophageal eosinophilia can have complete responses to proton pump inhibitor (ppi) therapy, typically used for the treatment of gerd, but these patients with ppi

is a progressive disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain (cerebrovascular). it is characterized by the narrowing (stenosis) and/or closing (occlusion) of the carotid artery inside the skull, a major artery that delivers blood to the brain. at the same time, tiny blood vessels at the base of the brain open up in an apparent attempt to supply blood to the brain distal to the blockage. these tiny vessels are the \"\"moyamoya\"\" vessels for which the disease was named. inadequate blood supply then leads to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, and it is this oxygen deprivation that causes the signs of moyamoya. one of the symptoms is typically stroke, which results in paralysis of the face, arms or legs, loss of speech, etc., or temporary loss of neurologic function of body parts or speech (transient ischemic attacks, or \"tia\"). other symptoms that may result include headaches, visual disturbances, developmental delay, and seizures. approximately 10% of cases of moyamoya in asian countries have a genetic cause. patients with this arteriopathy that occurs either on a familial or idiopathic basis are said to have moyamoya disease. patients in whom the artery changes occur in association with another process such as sickle cell disease or down syndrome are said to have moyamoya disease. in this report, we use the term \"\"moyamoya disease\"\" as shorthand for both forms. in japan, moyamoya disease typically occurs in females under the age of 20. in japan, the disease is estimated to occur in 1 per 300,000 people. although moyamoya was originally reported in individuals of japanese ancestry, cases have been reported from elsewhere in asia as well as from europe, north and south america, and most series reported in the western hemisphere have a minority of patients of asian descent.  of note, most patients in north america are isolated cases, with recent literature suggesting that less than 4% of cases in this population are familial. (gaillard 2017) in most patients, the diagnosis of moyamoya can be made from a careful assessment of an mri and mra. cerebral arteriography will confirm the diagnosis, establish the exact degree of blood vessel narrowing, demonstrate the existing blood flow patterns to various areas of the brain, and allow treatment decisions to be made; for these reasons, it is the standard diagnostic tool for this condition. in particular, catheter angiography can help with the identification of important blood vessels called \"transdural collaterals,\" which are present in some cases and can markedly influence surgical planning and prognosis.

gastric aspirates, or decreased bowel sounds with abdominal distention and tenderness. gross or occult blood can be present in stools indicating mucosal injury. many of these signs are non-specific and can occur with other disorders. progression of nec results in systemic signs such as lethargy, long pauses in breathing called apnea, temperature instability, and poor perfusion (pumping of fluid through an organ or tissue.) ultimately this can lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. a palpable mass and erythema (abnormal redness of the skin due to capillary congestion, as in inflammation) of the abdominal wall is indicative of a more advanced disease process. nec affects 5 to 10% of premature infants born weighing less than 1500 g. among the risk factors defined for nec, prematurity and birth weight remain inversely related to risk for nec. term infants who develop nec usually have specific risk factors such as congenital heart disease, sepsis, and low blood pressure. many other gastrointestinal diseases can mimic nec, so when evaluating a patient it is important to consider and treat alternative etiologies. sepsis can cause an ileus with abdominal distention and feeding intolerance. premature infants, especially those on indomethacin or steroids can also present with spontaneous intestinal perforation (sip). sip is characterized by isolated perforation of the distal small bowel. other causes of severe abdominal distention in neonates include bowel obstruction from hirshsprung's disease, small bowel atresia, meconium ileus, and malrotation with volvulus. nec can also be mistaken for allergic enterocolitis secondary to cow's milk protein allergy. nec is diagnosed clinically and radiographically.

cholangiocarcinomas or gallbladder cancers more frequently cause patients to develop jaundice due to tumor or lymph nodes blocking a major bile duct [4]. most cases of biliary tract cancer are sporadic, with no identifiable predisposing patient factors. there are several known risk factors for development of cholangiocarcinoma however, including liver cirrhosis, hepatitis b and c, biliary tract stones, liver fluke infections, a congenital anatomical abnormality called a choledochal cyst and the chronic condition of inflamed bile ducts also called primary sclerosing cholangitis. exposure to some industrial chemicals such as nitrosamines, dioxin, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls are also thought to increase an individual's risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.  in the usa, gallbladder cancer is commonly associated with the presence of long standing gallstones resulting in calcification of the gallbladder wall or \"porcelain gallbladder\".  gallbladder polyps are also associated with increased risk of gallbladder cancer. the incidence of bile duct cancers differs worldwide, likely reflecting both differing genetic predisposition and variable exposure to known risk factors[5]. approximately 12,000 new affected individuals of bile duct cancers are diagnosed in the usa each year, of which over 9,000 are gallbladder cancers and distal/perihilar cholangiocarcinomas and 3,000 are intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas [6]. the overall incidence of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in the united states is 1 person per 100,000 per year. the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the united states is approximately 0.7 per 100,000. during the last 30 years, it appears that the incidence of biliary tract cancers in the united states is increasing [7]. this increase may be due in part to increased recognition of the diagnosis of biliary cancer, cases which may previously have been classified as cancer of unknown origin. gallbladder cancer is more common in women than in men, and in some countries the rates are three times higher for women. certain geographic areas are characterized by a high incidence of gallbladder cancer, including chile, bolivia and india. a high incidence also has been documented in north american native americans and mexican americans [7]. a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer is made based on identification of characteristic symptoms (if present), a detailed patient history, clinical examination and several specialized tests including blood test, imaging tests and endoscopic procedures. either ct or mri scans may be used to assess the tumor size and to look for blockage of the bile ducts and sites of spread [9, 10]. ercp may be used to insert a stent into a blocked bile duct to relieve jaundice. a biopsy is usually required to confirm the pathologic diagnosis and may be obtained by a ct or endoscopic ultrasound (eus) guided biopsy [11]. some patients with gallbladder

the lysine metabolism. gcdh deficiency results in increased concentrations of potentially neurotoxic metabolites, glutaric acid (ga), 3-hydroxy glutaric acid (3-oh-ga) and glutaconic acid within body tissues, especially within the brain. two arbitrary biochemical subtypes have been defined, high (he) and low excretors (le), depending on the amount of ga in the urine. newborns may show unspecific clinical signs like enlarged head circumference (macrocephaly) or decreased muscle tone (hypotonia).  without treatment, most affected children develop an acute encephalopathic crisis following febrile illness episodes or other catabolic conditions resulting in bilateral striatal injury and consequently, dystonic movement disorder. cognitive outcome has not been systematically studied, but severe cognitive dysfunction is rarely seen. sometimes babies with ga1 have been mistaken to have been abused because they present with subdural and/or retinal hemorrhages. ga1 is included in the newborn screening panel in a growing number of countries which is essential for early intervention.  importantly, patients with the low excreting phenotype may be missed by newborn screening. ga1 is a

tremor. dystonia may occur or be worsened when an individual attempts a voluntary action. there are many different causes for dystonia. genetic as well as non-genetic factors can contribute to the development of these disorders. in some cases, the exact, underlying cause is unknown (idiopathic). the most characteristic finding associated with most forms of dystonia is twisting, repetitive movements that affect the neck, torso, limbs, eyes, face, vocal chords, and/or a combination of these muscle groups. certain forms such as laryngeal dystonia are not associated with abnormal postures. dystonia causes varying degrees of pain and disability that ranges from mild symptoms that come and go to severe, debilitating symptoms that can significantly affect a person's quality of life. in some cases dystonia can become progressively worse, while in others it remains unchanged or no longer worsens (plateaus). dystonia may even spontaneously remit in rare cases. treatment for dystonia depends upon several factors including the specific subtype present and can include medications, botulinum toxin injections, physical therapy and surgery. dystonia can affect individuals of any age, gender, race, or ethnic background. it is estimated that as many as 300,000 people in north america may be affected by the various forms of dystonia. however, because many cases of dystonia go

the abstract: $ biliary atresia is a rare gastrointestinal disorder characterized by destruction or absence of all or a portion of the bile duct that lies outside the liver (extrahepatic bile duct). the bile duct is a tube that allows the passage of bile from the liver into the gall bladder and, eventually, the small intestine. bile is a liquid secreted by the liver that plays an essential role in carrying waste products from the liver and promoting absorption of fats and vitamins by the intestines. in biliary atresia, absence or destruction of the bile ducts results in the abnormal accumulation of bile in the liver. affected infants have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and scarring of the liver (fibrosis). in some cases, additional abnormalities may be present, including heart defects and intestinal, spleen and kidney malformations. the exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown. biliary atresia is a rare disorder with a slight increased frequency in females. it occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 births in the united states. approximately 400-600 new cases of biliary atresia are encountered in the united states each year. according to one estimate, the prevalence of biliary atresia in europe is approximately 1 in 12,000 births. biliary atresia is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. the diagnosis of biliary atresia requires a direct examination of the bile ducts by abdominal surgery (laparotomy) and the microscopic examination of tissue from the liver (liver biopsy). during the surgery special contrast dye is injected into the gallbladder and x-ray films are taken to outline how the dye fills the major bile ducts (intraoperative cholangiogram). these films show the movement (or lack of movement) of the dye through bile ducts and into the small intestine. the physician/surgeon is then able to evaluate the structure of the bile ducts and to determine the site of the blockage (proximal or distal). blood tests may demonstrate elevated levels of liver enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and bilirubin and detect viral agents; high blood levels of matrix metalloproteinase-7 has been discovered to be highly specific for biliary atresia. ultrasound of the liver may show absence of the gall bladder. $ from the given abstract, find all the entities and

(galactorrhea). the most common symptom in men is impotence. the cause of pituitary tumors is unknown. most pituitary tumors are sporadic and not associated with genetic factors that are inherited or can be passed on to children. pituitary tumors that produce enough prolactin to affect health occur in approximately 14 out of 100,000 people. all patients who are shown to have a pituitary adenoma on mri or ct imaging should have a serum prolactin level checked and if their prolactin level is >150-200 ng/ml the patient likely harbors a prolactin secreting tumor which should be treated with a dopamine agonist medication rather than surgery. if the level is less, this could be due to a tumor <10 mm or lack of normal inhibition by hypothalamic dopamine which then permits the normal prolactin secreting cells to hypersecrete (stalk effect). the effect of certain medications, recreational drugs, macroprolactin (big prolactin molecule with no effect on the body), other medical conditions (like low thyroid function, hepatic or renal insufficiency) should be evaluated for these lower levels. a specialist consultation should be considered for such patients by an experienced endocrinologist. prolactinoma is treated with medications that act like dopamine (dopamine agonists) such as bromocriptine, quinagolide and cabergoline because dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion.

growth delays, resulting in short stature and low weight. they also develop a distinctive facial appearance characterized by a disproportionately small face in comparison to the head; an underdeveloped jaw (micrognathia); malformation and crowding of the teeth; abnormally prominent eyes; a small nose; prominent eyes and a subtle blueness around the mouth. in addition, by the second year of life, the scalp hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes are lost (alopecia), and the scalp hair may be replaced by small, downy, white or blond hairs. additional characteristic features include generalized atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke, hip dislocations, unusually prominent veins of the scalp, loss of the layer of fat beneath the skin (subcutaneous adipose tissue), defects of the nails, joint stiffness, skeletal defects, and/or other abnormalities. according to reports in the medical literature, individuals with hgps develop premature, widespread thickening and

characterized by brittle, tangled, sparse, steely or kinky hair that is often white, ivory, or gray in color.  unusual facial features include pudgy cheeks and abnormal eyebrows.  affected infants are often born prematurely. lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and excess bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) may occur causing a yellow appearance (jaundice). hypothermia may also occur in older infants.  in some cases, early symptoms may resolve, and normal or slightly slowed development may proceed for two to three months.  severe developmental delay, loss of early development skills, and convulsions may occur.  brain abnormalities such as a blood clot at the base of the brain (subdural hematoma) and/or rupture or thrombosis of arteries in the brain not infrequently occur. spastic dementia and seizures may eventually arise.  weakened bones (osteoporosis) are common and can result in fractures. the combination of subdural hematoma and bone fractures may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of child abuse.  emphysema, bladder abnormalities, degeneration of the retina and cysts of the iris have also been described. in rare cases, symptoms are very mild

areas of the body into the bloodstream. lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. as lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it is filtered by a network of small structures known as lymph nodes that help to remove microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) and other foreign bodies. groups of lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including, but not limited to, the neck, under the arms (axillae), at the elbows, and in the chest, abdomen, and groin. lymphocytes are stored within lymph nodes and may also be found in other lymphatic tissues. in addition to the lymph nodes, the lymphatic system includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes, and bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. lymphatic tissue or circulating lymphocytes may also be located in other regions of the body. there are two main types of lymphocytes: b-lymphocytes (b-cells), which may produce specific antibodies to \"\"neutralize\"\" certain invading microorganisms, and t-lymphocytes (t-cells), which may

the blood. it is a symptom of another disease or condition, or a side effect of diuretic drugs. the body needs potassium for the contraction of muscles (including the heart), and for the functioning of many complicated proteins (enzymes). potassium is found primarily in the skeletal muscle and bone, and participates with sodium to contribute to the normal flow of body fluids between the cells in the body. the normal concentration of potassium in the body is regulated by the kidneys through the excretion of urine. when the kidneys are functioning normally, the amount of potassium in the diet is sufficient for use by the body and the excess is usually excreted through urine and sweat. body chemicals and hormones such as aldosterone also regulate potassium balance. secretion of the hormone insulin, which is normally stimulated by food, prevents a temporary diet-induced hypokalemia by increasing cell absorption of potassium. when hypokalemia occurs, there is an imbalance resulting from a dysfunction in this normal process, or the rapid loss of urine or sweat without replacement of sufficient potassium. hypokalemia may affect both males and females.  however, it occurs more commonly in females. the underlying cause of hypokalemia must first be treated. when the hypokalemia is severe, potassium chloride may be administered orally or intravenously. treatment must be carefully monitored by a physician. any associated acid-base disorders or hormonal disturbances must be evaluated before treatment is planned. the administration of potassium and potassium- sparing diuretics is usually discouraged in patients with kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system. the imbalance of external and internal potassium levels in these individuals may predispose them to life-threatening degrees of hyperkalemia (too much potassium). hypokalemia in individuals with high blood pressure taking diuretics may be improved by replacing lost potassium in the diet through certain fruits or potassium drugs. hypokalemia may also be minimized by dietary restriction of salt since high rates of sodium excretion promote urinary potassium losses. people

distribution and appearance. neurological abnormalities that can be associated with enss can include seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis). skeletal abnormalities can include abnormal curvature of the spine, malformation of the hip and abnormalities of the arms and legs (e.g., underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of

rickets have been associated with schimmelpenning syndrome. the specific symptoms and severity of enss can vary greatly from one person to another. most enss occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically), most likely due to a gene mutation that occurs after fertilization (postzygotic mutation) and is present in only some of the cells of the body (mosaic pattern). epidermal nevi

been estimated to be 5,000-6,000. tumors usually arise from the intestinal tract with the most common site being the stomach, followed by the small intestine, and then the colon/rectum with rare cases arising in the esophagus. there are also tumors that appear to arise in the membranous tissue lining the wall of the stomach (peritoneum) or in a fold of such membranous tissue (the omentum). there are also case reports of tumors arising in the appendix and/or pancreas. these tumors most commonly present with abdominal pain, bleeding or signs of intestinal obstruction. they spread most commonly to sites within the abdominal cavity and to the liver, although there are rare cases of spread to the lungs and bone. some gists are noncancerous (benign) and do not spread (indolent); others are aggressive with extensive local invasion as well as distant metastases. most cases result from a change (mutation) in one of two genes, kit or pdgfr, which leads to continued growth and division of tumor cells. there are a few reported cases of families in which a gene mutation is inherited; however, the majority of tumors occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically) and not inherited (acquired mutation). most cases arise in older adults. leiomyosarcomas of the intestinal tract arise in a similar location and can be confused with gist. leiomyosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells. there are essentially two types of muscles in the body - voluntary and involuntary. smooth muscles are involuntary muscles - the brain has no conscious control over them. smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. for example, smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive tract causes wave-like contractions (peristalsis) that aid in the digestion and transport of food. smooth muscles in the salivary glands cause the glands to squirt saliva into the mouth in response to taking a bite of food. smooth muscle in the skin causes goose bumps to form in response to cold. leiomyosarcoma usually spreads via the bloodstream. it is very rare to see it in lymphatics. since smooth muscle is found all over the body, a leiomyosarcoma can form almost anywhere where there are blood vessels, heart, liver, pancreas, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract, the space behind the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneum), uterus, skin. the uterus is the most common location for a leiomyosarcoma. most leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract are now reclassified as gists. the exact cause of leiomyosarcoma,
