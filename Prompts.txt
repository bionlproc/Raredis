TASK: Your task is to extract all relevant triples from a biomedical text. Each triple has a chemical mention, a gene/protein mention and a predicate between two mentions. The predicate belongs to one of the following 5 relations: 'CPR:3', 'CPR:4', 'CPR:5', 'CPR:6' and 'CPR:9'.
'CPR:3' includes UPREGULATOR, ACTIVATOR and INDIRECT UPREGULATOR
'CPR:4' includes DOWNREGULATOR, INHIBITOR and INDIRECT DOWNREGULATOR
'CPR:5' includes AGONIST, AGONIST ACTIVATOR and AGONIST INHIBITOR
'CPR:6' includes ANTAGONIST
'CPR:9' includes SUBSTRATE, PRODUCT OF and SUBSTRATE PRODUCT OF
Note chemical or gene/protein mentions should have appeared from the original text.

The output triples should be saved in a list of lists as per the following format:
[
    [Chemical1, Gene1, Predicate1],
    [Chemical2, Gene2, Predicate2],
    ...
]
The list will be empty if there are no relevant triple in the text. 

With this format, a hypothetical example output for a biomedical text could be the following:
[
    ["polyamines", "caspase", "CPR:3"],
    ["DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine", "ornithine decarboxylase", "CPR:4"],
    ["putrescine", "ODC", "CPR:9"]
]

With these instructions, now extract all relevant triples from the following text:
