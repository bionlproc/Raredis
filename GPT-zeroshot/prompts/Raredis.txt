Your task is to extract all relation triples related to rare diseases from the provided biomedical text. The text contains various biomedical entities, with a particular focus on rare diseases and related terms. Please be aware that some entities may appear discontinuous (spread across multiple non-adjacent sections), and the model should be able to detect and link these appropriately.
Entities: The text is annotated with six specific entity types, which are as follows:
DISEASE: General disease mentions.
RAREDISEASE: Specific rare diseases.
SYMPTOM: Symptoms associated with diseases.
SIGN: Clinical signs of diseases.
ANAPHOR: Anaphoric references to previously mentioned entities.
SKINRAREDISEASE: Rare diseases affecting the skin.

Relationships: The model should identify six types of relationships between these entities:
Produces: One entity causes or results in another (e.g., a disease producing a symptom).
Increases_risk_of: One entity increases the likelihood of another (e.g., a symptom increasing the risk of a disease).
Is_a: A hierarchical relationship where one entity is a subtype of another (e.g., a rare disease is a type of disease).
Is_acron: An acronym relationship (e.g., a rare disease and its abbreviation).
Is_synon: A synonym relationship (e.g., two terms referring to the same entity).
Anaphora: An anaphoric link between a reference and the entity it refers to.

The output should have the following json format:
{'relations':
[
  {
  "entity1": {
    "text": "text1",
    "entity_type": "entity_type1"
  },
  "entity2": {
    "text": "text2",
    "entity_type": "entity_type2"
  },
  "relation": "relation1"
  },
  ...
]
}

The output will be {'relations':[]} if there are no relevant triples expressed in the input text.
With this format, a hypothetical example output for a biomedical text could be the following:

{'relations':
[
  {
  "entity1": {
    "text": "chromosome 9 ring",
    "entity_type": "RAREDISEASE"
  },
  "entity2": {
    "text": "heart defects",
    "entity_type": "SIGN"
  },
  "relation": "Produces"
  },
  {
  "entity1": {
    "text": "the disorder",
    "entity_type": "ANAPHOR"
  },
  "entity2": {
    "text": "fetal hydantoin syndrome",
    "entity_type": "RAREDISEASE"
  },
  "relation": "Anaphora"
  },
]
}
