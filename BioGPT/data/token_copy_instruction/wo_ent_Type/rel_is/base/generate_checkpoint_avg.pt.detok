consider the abstract: $arteriovenous malformation (avm) is a vascular lesion that is a tangle of vessels of varying sizes in which there is one or more direct connections between the arterial and venous circulations. in the lesion there is no capillary bed, which is part of normal tissue. brain avms are often presumed to be congenital, but there is no direct evidence that they form in utero. the distribution of age at detection for brain avms is normally-distributed with the mean age in the mid-30's. although a small number of avms manifest themselves at or shortly after birth, most of them present later in life, and just as likely, form and progress during the later years of life. the lack of capillaries allows blood traveling through the abnormal fistulous connections to flow rapidly. the low resistance of the direct a-v connections, termed fistulas, results in very high flow rates in the vessels leading to and within the avm. these high flow rates can lower the pressure in the arteries leading to the avm and to surrounding relatively normal brain tissue. further, because of the direct a-v connections, the pressure in the arteries, even if somewhat reduced, are transmitted to the veins draining the avm and surrounding brain, which normally operate at very low pressures. avm can occur in many different parts of the body, but those located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can cause problems that affect the brain like other forms of stroke. avm are often attributed to result from an error in embryonic or fetal development, but there is no direct evidence of this assertion. no environmental risk factors have been identified for neurological avm. avm does not usually run in families, but somewhere on the order of 5% of avms may be due to autosomal dominant inheritance of a genetic mutation, most commonly hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or the capillary malformation-avm syndrome. avm can rarely be associated with certain syndromes such as wyburn-mason syndrome. avm affects males and females in equal numbers. there does not appear to be an increased risk for particular ethnic and racial groups. the best estimates for new detection of an avm are 1 per 100,000 population per year (about 3000 new cases detected per year in the u.s.) the population prevalence is about 10 per 100,000, i.e., there are probably about 30,000 individuals in the u.s. who harbor an avm or have had an avm that was treated. they occur throughout life, but the peak onset of symptoms is 35-40 years of age. $from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them. do not generate any token outside the abstract. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relationship between arteriovenous malformation and vascular lesion is hyponym; the relationship between arteriovenous malformation and "they" is antecedent; the relationship between avm and arteriovenous malformation is acronym; the relationship between "they" and brain lesions is hyponym; the relationship between "they" and no capillary bed is producer; the relationship between "they" and low resistance of the direct a-v connections is producer; the relationship between "they" and high flow rates in the arteries is producer; the relationship between "they" and veins is producer; the relationship between "they" and pressure in the arteries is producer; the relationship between "it" and veins is producer; the relationship between avm and "it" is antecedent; the relationship between avm and "the syndrome" is antecedent.

consider the abstract: $cat eye syndrome (ces) is a rare chromosomal disorder that may be evident at birth. individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up have two 22nd chromosomes, both of which have a short arm, known as 22p, and a long arm, known as 22q. however, in individuals with ces, the short arm and a small region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (i.e., 22pter-22q11) are present four times (partial tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. in a small number of people with ces, the 22q11 region is present in 3 copies (partial trisomy). the name "cat eye syndrome" is derived from a distinctive eye (ocular) abnormality that is present in a little over half affected individuals. this defect, known as a coloboma, usually appears as a cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil, and the elongated pupil therefore resembles the appearance of a cat's eye. there are, however, many other features associated with ces involving many organs and systems. these symptoms result from abnormal development during embryo and fetal stages. associated symptoms vary greatly in presence and severity from one person to another, including among members of the same family. ces may be best thought of as a disorder spectrum. while some people may have few or mild manifestations, others may have multiple severe malformations. ces has been recognized for more than a century. more than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature, including apparently sporadic and familial cases. many more affected individuals exist but have not been described in the medical literature. however, the syndrome is very rare, and currently there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of ces in the population. schinzel et al (1981) estimated an incidence of approximately one in 50,000 to one in 150,000 individuals in northeastern switzerland. because some affected individuals develop few associated features, however, the disorder may in some people remain unrecognized. there is currently no way to estimate how underdiagnosed this syndrome is. $from the given abstract, find all the entities and relations among them. do not generate any token outside the abstract. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relationship between cat eye syndrome and chromosomal disorder is hyponym; the relationship between cat eye syndrome and "this disorder" is antecedent; the relationship between ces and cat eye syndrome is acronym; the relationship between "this defect" and coloboma is producer; the relationship between "this defect" and eye abnormality is producer; the relationship between "this defect" and cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil is producer; the relationship between "this defect" and elongated pupil is producer; the relationship between "this defect" and cat eye syndrome is producer; the relationship between ces and "the syndrome" is antecedent; the relationship between ces and "the disorder" is antecedent; the relationship between ces and "this syndrome" is antecedent.

consider the abstract: $pseudocholinesterase deficiency is an uncommon genetic disorder that makes an affected person very sensitive to any of several anesthetic agents, especially those derived from the drug known as choline. when anesthetic drugs such as succinylcholine or mivacurium are administered to a susceptible person, the muscles that work the lungs may become paralyzed. mechanical ventilation is essential until the excess anesthetic agent is metabolized and normal breathing is resumed. individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency have a shortage or absence of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase in their blood serum. if the drug succinylcholine (or another anesthetic derivative of choline) is given during surgery, the respiratory muscles become paralyzed and the patient stops breathing (apnea). artificial respiration (mechanical ventilation) may be necessary until the drug is eliminated from the body and the affected individual is able to resume breathing. if the person with pseudocholinesterase deficiency is not exposed to a choline-derived anesthetic, he or she may never be aware of having a deficiency of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. pseudocholinesterase deficiency is present at birth and occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1,500 to 2,500 people in the united states. among caucasian americans, it seems to affect males almost twice as often as females. apnea is the temporary cessation of breathing during sleep. infantile apnea refers to pauses in breathing during an infant's sleep. apnea is called central apnea or diaphragmatic apnea when there are no chest movements during the pauses in breathing. when there are chest movements but no passage of air through the mouth or nostrils, the disorder is known as obstructive apnea or upper airway apnea. central apnea followed by or intermixed with an obstructive apnea is called mixed apnea.
