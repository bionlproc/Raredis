Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the end (distal) portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 3 is missing (deleted or monosomic). The range and severity of symptoms and findings may be variable. However, associated features often include growth delays before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency); severe to profound mental retardation; distinctive malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; eyebrows that grow together (synophrys); and/or excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis). Additional physical abnormalities may also be present. In many cases, Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p appears to occur spontaneously (de novo) for unknown reasons. Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  Since the disorder was originally reported in 1978 (Verjaal M), approximately 34 cases have been described in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those associated with Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p.  Chromosomal analysis is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.
