Cogan-Reese syndrome is an extremely rare eye disorder characterized by a matted or smudged appearance to the surface of the iris; the development of small colored lumps on the iris (nodular iris nevi); the attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae); and/or increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma). Secondary glaucoma may lead to vision loss. This disorder most frequently appears in young and middle-aged females, usually affecting only one eye (unilateral) and developing slowly over time. Cogan-Reese syndrome is a very rare disorder that predominantly affects females in the middle adult years, although cases have been reported in children. Most affected individuals are white. The male to female ratio ranges from 1:2 to 1:5. A family history usually shows no other affected family members.
