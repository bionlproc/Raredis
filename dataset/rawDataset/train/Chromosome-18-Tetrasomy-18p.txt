"Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p is a very rare chromosomal disorder in which the short arm of the 18th chromosome (18p) appears four times (tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up (karyotype) have two 18th chromosomes, both of which have a short arm (""18p"") and a long arm (""18q""). However, in individuals with Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p, four short arms (18ps) are present in cells of the body rather than the normal two. Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p is a very rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females equally.  Approximately 40 cases have been reported in the medical literature."
