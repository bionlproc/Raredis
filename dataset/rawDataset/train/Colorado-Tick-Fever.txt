Major symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle aches, and/or generalized discomfort (myalgia). The symptoms usually last for about a week and resolve on their own. Colorado Tick Fever is a rare viral disease caused by a virus belonging to the Coltivirus family.  It is transmitted to humans through the bite of the wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). Colorado Tick Fever is a rare viral disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Most reported cases have occurred in the Rocky Mountain area of the United States and the western provinces of Canada.  Several hundred cases of this disease are reported each year in these areas where the wood tick lives (endemic).  However, it is possible that many additional cases are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed.
