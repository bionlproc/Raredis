Cervical teratomas are extremely rare germ cell tumors (neoplasm) that occur in the neck. The majority of teratomas occur in the testes or ovaries (gonads) or the lower back (sacrococcygeal region). In rare cases, other areas such as the neck may be affected. Most cervical tumors occur in children and are non-cancerous (benign). In extremely rare cases, cervical teratomas occur in adults and are usually cancerous (malignant). Cervical teratomas affect men and women in equal numbers. Germ cell tumors account for 3-5 percent of all tumors in childhood. Cervical teratomas are much more common in newborns than adults. Fewer than 50 cases of cervical teratomas in adults have been reported in the medical literature.
