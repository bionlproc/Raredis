"Chromosome 9, Tetrasomy 9p is a very rare chromosomal disorder in which the short arm of the ninth chromosome (9p) appears four times (tetrasomy) rather than twice in all or some cells of the body. Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up (karyotype) have two 9th chromosomes, both of which have a short arm (""9p"") and a long arm (""9q""). However, in individuals with Chromosome 9, Tetrasomy 9p, four short arms (9ps) are present in cells rather than the normal two. Chromosome 9, Tetrasomy 9p is a very rare chromosomal disorder that appears  to affect males slightly more often than females.  Approximately 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature."
