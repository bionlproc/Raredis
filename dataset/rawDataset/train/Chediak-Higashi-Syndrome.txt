Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. It is often obvious at birth or shortly thereafter. There does not appear to be a higher risk for any particular ethnic or racial group. There are less than 500 cases of the disease on record. 85% of affected individuals progress to the accelerated phase.
