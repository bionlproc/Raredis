Congenital afibrinogenemia is a very rare disorder that affects approximately one in a million people. Males and females are equally affected. There doesnâ€™t seem to be any ethnic predisposition to this disease [6, 15]. However, as it is an autosomal recessive disorder, children whose parents are blood relatives (consanguineous) are more at risk. Indeed, individuals from the same family are more likely to have the same rare mutation and can have an affected child if he or she inherits the mutation from both parents. Therefore, the disease is more common in areas with high rates of consanguineous marriage, such as the Middle East and Southern India [16].
