Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of leukemia found in multiple family members. It is twice as common in males as in females and the average age of onset in patients is 72. It is also more common in people that are white, or of Russian and Eastern European Jewish heritage. The rate of incidence of the disorder increases with age. CLL almost never affects children and is rare under the age of thirty. In the United States, it is thought that three out of every 100,000 people will develop CLL, but this may be an underestimate.
