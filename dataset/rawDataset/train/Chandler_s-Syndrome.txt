Chandler's syndrome (CS) is a rare eye disorder in which the endothelium, the single layer of cells lining the interior of the cornea, proliferates causing corneal edema, distortion of the iris, and unusually high pressure in the eye (glaucoma). CS is one of three syndromes affecting the eyes (progressive iris atrophy and Cogan-Reese syndrome are the other two) that make up the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE syndrome). The spectrum is an acquired, unilateral disorder, which typically occurs in early to middle adulthood and predominantly affects women.  Chandler's syndrome is the most commonly encountered clinical variant of this spectrum. Chandlerâ€™s syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects females more often than it does males. The disorder usually appears during young adult to middle aged years. However, its occurrence in a child and a teenager has been reported. ICE syndrome has been described in different ethnic groups, although the prevalence of the 3 clinical variants may vary among ethnicities.
