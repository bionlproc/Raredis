Cicatricial alopecias are classified as primary or secondary. This discussion is confined to the primary cicatricial alopecias, in which the hair follicle is the target of a destructive inflammatory process. In secondary cicatricial alopecias, destruction of the hair follicle is incidental to a non-follicle-directed process or external injury, such as severe infections, burns, radiation, or tumors. The cause of the various cicatricial alopecias is not well understood. However, all types of cicatricial alopecias involve inflammation directed at the upper part of the hair follicle where the stem cells and sebaceous gland (oil gland) are located. If the stem cells and sebaceous gland are destroyed, there is no possibility for regeneration of the hair follicle, leading to permanent hair loss. Cicatricial alopecias are not contagious.
