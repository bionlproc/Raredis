VPS13B/COH1 Cohen syndrome affects males and females in about equal numbers. It appears to occur more frequently in people of Finnish, Amish, Greek/Mediterranean and Irish ancestry. More than 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature and an estimated 500-1,000 individuals have been diagnosed with the disorder worldwide. However, instances of Cohen syndrome often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population.
