"Chromosome 14, Trisomy Mosaic is a rare chromosomal disorder in which chromosome 14 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in some cells of the body. The term ""mosaic"" indicates that some cells contain the extra chromosome 14, whereas others have the normal chromosomal pair. In observed cases, Chromosome 14, Trisomy Mosaic has appeared to affect females more frequently than males. Since the chromosomal syndrome was originally described in the medical literature, over 20 cases have been reported. Other chromosomal disorders may be characterized by symptoms and findings similar to those potentially associated with Chromosome 14, Trisomy Mosaic.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such chromosomal disorders, choose the name of the specific disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)"
