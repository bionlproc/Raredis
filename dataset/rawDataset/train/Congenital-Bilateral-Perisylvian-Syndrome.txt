CBPS is a rare neurological disorder that was first recognized as a distinct syndrome in the early 1990s. The disorder is usually apparent at birth (congenital) or early in life, based upon characteristic physical findings and specialized imaging tests. In affected individuals who exhibit infantile spasms, onset of these sudden, involuntary contractions tends to occur within the first six months of life. Onset of other forms of epilepsy potentially associated with CBPS (e.g., atypical absence seizures, atonic-tonic seizures, and/or tonic-clonic seizures) may occur between two to 12 years of life. CBPS appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. Various subtypes have been described based on radiological features as seen on MRI; the prevalence is now known.Â  In a recent review of 35 new cases of polymicrogyria, 22 had bilateral perisylvian distribution (Flotats-Bastardas et al 2012).
