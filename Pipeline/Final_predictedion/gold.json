{"Chromosome-6-Partial-Trisomy-6q": {"abstract": "chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of the 6th chromosome (6q) is present three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. associated symptoms and findings may vary in range and severity from case to case. however, many affected infants and children have slow physical development (growth retardation); mental retardation; malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; an unusually short, webbed neck; abnormal bending (flexion) or extension of certain joints in fixed postures (joint contractures); and/or other physical abnormalities. in most cases, chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q has been the result of a balanced translocation in one of the parents. chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females equally.  approximately 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those potentially associated with chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q.  chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.

individuals with ces, the short arm and a small region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (i.e., 22pter-22q11) are present four times (partial tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. in a small number of people with ces, the 22q11 region is present in 3 copies (partial trisomy).  the name \"cat eye syndrome\" is derived from a distinctive eye (ocular) abnormality that is present in a little over half affected individuals. this defect, known as a coloboma, usually appears as a cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil, and the elongated pupil therefore resembles the appearance of a cat's eye. there are, however, many other features associated with ces involving many organs and systems. these symptoms result from abnormal development during embryo and fetal stages. associated symptoms vary greatly in presence and severity from one person to another, including among members of the same family. ces may be best thought of as a disorder spectrum. while some people may have few or mild manifestations, others may have multiple severe malformations. ces has been recognized for more than a century. more than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature, including apparently sporadic and familial cases. many more affected individuals exist but have not been described in the medical literature. however, the syndrome is very rare, and currently there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of ces in the population. schinzel et al (1981) estimated an incidence of approximately one in 50,000 to one in 150,000 individuals in northeastern switzerland.
