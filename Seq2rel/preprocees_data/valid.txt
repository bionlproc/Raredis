Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II (TRPS2), also known as Langer-Giedion syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS2 is characterized by fine, thin hair; unusual facial features; progressive growth retardation resulting in short stature (dwarfism); abnormally short fingers and toes (brachydactyly); "cone-shaped" formation of the "growing ends" of certain bones (epiphyseal coning); and/or development of multiple bony growths (exostoses) projecting outward from the surfaces of various bones of the body. In addition, affected individuals may exhibit unusually flexible (hyperextensible) joints, diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), excess folds of skin (redundant skin), and/or discolored elevated spots on the skin (maculopapular nevi). Affected individuals may also exhibit mild to severe mental retardation, hearing loss (sensorineural deafness), and/or delayed speech development. The range and severity of symptoms varies greatly from case to case. TRPS2 is due to the absence of genetic material (chromosomal deletions) on chromosome 8. The size of the deletion varies from case to case.

Tropical Sprue is a rare digestive disease in which the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients is impaired (malabsorption). Consequently, nutritional deficiencies and abnormalities in the mucous lining of the small intestine may be present. The exact cause of this disorder is not known, however it may be related to environmental and nutritional conditions in the tropical regions where it is most prevalent. The exact cause of Tropical Sprue is not known.  It is an acquired disorder that may be related to environmental and nutritional factors, or Tropical Sprue may be related to an infectious organism (either viral or bacterial), dietary toxin, parasitic infestation, or a nutritional deficiency such as folic acid.  Tropical Sprue causes damage to the mucosal lining of the intestine resulting the impaired absorption of food, minerals, and water. Tropical Sprue is a rare disorder in temperate regions.  It occurs mainly in the tropical regions of the Caribbean, India, South Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Transients, tourists and visitors to these areas can be affected. Treatment for Tropical Sprue includes the use of folic acid, cobalamin, and antibiotics such as tetracycline, oxytetracycline, or ampicillin. The dosage of these medications depends on the severity of the disorder as well as how the patient responds to the therapy. Combined therapy with folic acid and tetracycline seems to rapidly reduce the severity of the symptoms and also heal unhealthy tissue in the small intestine. Other nutrients may be given as needed (i.e., iron, vitamin B12). Diarrhea associated with this disorder may be controlled with anti-diarrhea agents.

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is characterized by the development of a tumor (gastrinoma) or tumors that secrete excessive levels of gastrin, a hormone that stimulates production of acid by the stomach. Many affected individuals develop multiple gastrinomas, which are thought to have the potential to be cancerous (malignant). In most patients, the tumors arise within the pancreas and/or the upper region of the small intestine (duodenum). Due to excessive acid production (gastric acid hypersecretion), individuals with ZES may develop peptic ulcers of the stomach, the duodenum, and/or other regions of the digestive tract. Peptic ulcers are sores or raw areas within the digestive tract where the lining has been eroded by stomach acid and digestive juices. Symptoms and findings associated with ZES may include mild to severe abdominal pain; diarrhea; increased amounts of fat in the stools (steatorrhea); and/or other abnormalities. In most affected individuals, ZES appears to develop randomly (sporadically) for unknown reasons. In approximately 25 percent of patients, ZES occurs in association with a genetic syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). All of the tumors are considered to have malignant potential. Prognosis is related to tumor size and the presence of distant metastases. ZES may become apparent at any age. However, symptom onset usually occurs between ages 30 and 60 years. The exact frequency of ZES in the general population is unknown. However, some researchers estimate that ZES represents less than one percent of peptic ulcers.

VKC symptoms include inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye. This causes the eyes to become red and may cause blurred vision. The eyes become sensitive to light and itch intensely. Usually both eyes are affected, and cobblestone-like changes appear in the upper eyelid linings (palpebral conjunctiva). In other patients, a gelatinous nodule may develop in the tissue adjacent to the cornea (limbus). In very severe cases, the corneas may scar (shield ulcers) or clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur, leading to temporarily or permanently reduced vision. Onset of VKC typically occurs at about 11 years of age, but onset can be between 3 and 25 years of age. The disorder appears to affect more males than females. Usually patients with VKC have a family history of atopic diseases, such as asthma, eczema, or rhinitis. It occurs most often during the spring or summer but up to 60% of patients experience recurrences in the winter periodically. It is more present in climates that are dry and warm.

Tethered cord syndrome is a stretch-induced functional disorder associated with the fixation (tethering) effect of inelastic tissue on the caudal spinal cord, limiting its movement. This abnormal attachment is associated with progressive stretching and increased tension of the spinal cord as a child ages, potentially resulting in a variety of neurological and other symptoms. Due to the variation of the growth rate of the spinal cord and the spinal column, the progression of neurological signs and symptoms is highly variable. Some individuals present with tethered cord syndrome at birth (so-called congenital), while others develop the symptomatology in infancy or early childhood. Other individuals may not develop any noticeable symptoms until adulthood. Although some authors call these cases acquired, the majority of these cases are mostly developmental, corresponding to the progressive development of excess fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis) in the filum terminale. The filum terminale is a strand of tissue that bridges the spinal cord tip and the tailbone (sacrum). The inelastic structures in children originated from defective closure of the neural tube (the precursor of the spinal cord) during embryonic development, eventually forming a condition known as spina bifida. Because of its functional (physiological) nature, tethered cord syndrome can be reversible if surgically treated in its early stage.

AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4 Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG51 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizure, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.

Usher syndrome affects approximately three to ten in 100,000 people worldwide. Higher than average numbers of people with Usher syndrome have been found among Jewish people in Israel, Berlin, Germany; French Canadians of Louisiana; Argentineans of Spanish descent; and Nigerian Africans. USH3, the rarest form in most populations, comprises about 40% of Usher patients in Finland. Usher syndrome is the most common genetic disorder involving both hearing and vision abnormalities. Usher syndrome types 1 and 2 account for approximately 10 percent of all cases of moderate to profound deafness in children. Usher syndrome is diagnosed by hearing, balance and vision examinations. A hearing (audiologic) exam measures the frequency and loudness of sounds that a person can hear. An electroretinogram measures the electrical response to the light-sensitive cells in the retina of the eyes. A retinal exam is done to observe the retina and other structures in the back of the eye. Vestibular (balance) function can be assessed by a variety of tests that evaluate different parts of the balance system. Genetic testing is clinically available for most of the genes associated with Usher syndrome.

Trisomy 13 Syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a portion of chromosome 13 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body.

XYY syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of an extra Y chromosome. Normally, males have 46 chromosomes including one X and one Y chromosome. Males with XYY syndrome have 47 chromosomes, two of which are Y chromosomes. Most cases of XYY syndrome are due to a cell division error in the sperm prior to conception. Rarely, the cell division error occurs after conception resulting in a mosiac of cells with 46 chromosomes and 47 chromosomes. The exact cause for why these errors in cell division occur is not understood. XYY syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder present at birth that affects only males. It is estimated to occur in approximately one in 1,000 live births.

Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence, which has doubled in the last decade (based on national hospitalization data), is estimated to be between .09 and .56 per 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. However, these estimates may reflect cases reported in the medical literature and the disorder most likely is more common in the United States than estimated, particularly in infants and young children. The majority of cases are in children under the age of 6. Newborns (neonates) are at particular risk because they do not have fully developed immune systems, do not have neutralizing antibodies for the toxin, and their kidneys cannot fully clear toxins from the body yet. For similar reasons certain adults, specifically adults with a compromised immune system or poor kidney function, are at a greater risk than the general population of developing the disorder.

Wilson disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disease is found in all races and ethnic groups. Although estimates vary, it is believed that Wilson's disease occurs in approximately one in 30,000 to 40,000 people worldwide. Approximately one in 90 people may be carriers of the disease gene. Although only about 2,000-3,000 cases have been diagnosed in the United States, other affected individuals may be misdiagnosed with other neurological, liver or psychiatric disorders. According to one estimate, there may actually be 9,000 people affected by Wilson's disease in the United States.	Wilson disease @RAREDISEASE@ The disease @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@ 
Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III (TRPS3), also known as Sugio-Kajii syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS3 is characterized by fine, thin light-colored hair; unusual facial features; abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes; and multiple abnormalities of the "growing ends" (epiphyses) of the bones (skeletal dysplasia), especially in the hands and feet. Characteristic facial features may include a pear-shaped or rounded (bulbous) nose; an abnormally long prominent groove (philtrum) in the upper lip; and/or abnormalities such as delayed eruption of teeth. In addition, affected individuals also exhibit severe shortening of the fingers and toes (brachydactyly) due to improper development of bones in the hands and feet (metacarpophalangeal shortening). Additional features often include short stature (dwarfism) and/or additional skeletal abnormalities. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. TRPS3 is thought to have autosomal dominant inheritance. Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III is an extremely rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. However, of the reported cases, most affected individuals have been female. Approximately 15 cases have been reported in the medical literature. A diagnosis of trichrhinophalangeal syndome type III may be suspected based upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., fine, sparse hair; facial abnormalities; etc.). The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and X-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal severe shortening of bones in the hands and feet (i.e., metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges) and the abnormal development of the "growing ends" (epiphyses) of the phalangeal bones (epiphyseal coning).

The most conclusive processes for the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia include a bone marrow aspirate, blood counts, and ELA2 genetic testing. The aspirate follows a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and blood tests (i.e., white blood cell count) that measure the various types of blood cells in the circulation. In individuals with severe chronic neutropenia, such blood counts demonstrate abnormally low levels of neutrophils. Normal counts of neutrophils range between 1.5 and 7 billion cells per liter of blood. If the neutrophil count falls below 0.5, then severe neutropenia is suggested.	severe chronic neutropenia @RAREDISEASE@ low levels of neutrophils @SIGN@ @Produces@ severe neutropenia @RAREDISEASE@ neutrophil count falls below 0.5 @SIGN@ @Produces@ 
Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare genetic skeletal disorder characterized by the abnormal development of bone (osseousbo dysplasia). Affected individuals exhibit bowing of the long portions (shafts) of the shinbone (tibia) and the outer, smaller bone of the leg below the knee (fibula). In some individuals, other bones may also be affected, such as the ribs, pelvis, spinal column, and/or bones in the arms. Affected individuals will have some degree of short stature, which means that they are shorter than would otherwise be expected based on their gender and age. The medical definition states that short stature is two standard deviations or more below the mean for children of the same age and gender. The final height of affected individuals will vary. Researchers believe that alterations (mutations) in a gene result in Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome. However, they have not been able to find such a gene. Researchers also believe that the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare skeletal disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 70 people have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder's original description in 1954. However, because rare disorders like Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome often go unrecognized, these disorders are under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.

Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) has been defined as the absence of bone overlying the superior semicircular canal facing toward the dura of the middle cranial fossa. SSCD has been implicated as the cause of a variety of inner ear symptoms including Tullio's phenomenon, pressure induced vertigo, aural fullness, autophony, conductive hearing loss, and fluctuating or progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, SSCD has also been reported to be asymptomatic. In the past, many patients with SSCD had been misdiagnosed as having otosclerosis, patulous eustachian tubes, middle ear perilymphatic fistulas, or Meniere's disease. Identification of this entity requires a high degree of suspicion, appropriate findings on physical exam, lab testing, and confirmation on high-resolution CT scan. Surgical repair of the SSCD or occlusion of the superior canal has been reported with a high degree of symptom resolution. SSCD has been labelled the "great otologic mimicker" because it can simulate the symptoms of so many other ear disorders. However, the most common symptoms are vertigo/dizziness elicited by pressure altering activity, Tullio's phenomenon (sound-induced vertigo), fullness/pressure in the ear and autophony.  Autophony is hearing internal noises louder than would be expected, such as hearing your eyes move/blink, heart beat or joint movements. Hearing loss and fluctuating hearing loss can occur, mimicking otosclerosis or Meniere's disease. Fullness in the ear and hearing your breathing loudly in the ear are symptoms of patulous eustachian tube, but can also be found with SSCD.  Finally, most patients with the anatomic defect of superior semicircular canal dehiscence have no symptoms at all for some time prior to developing symptoms. SSCD can affect all age groups. There are no studies looking at the demographics of SSCD, however, the vast majority of patients diagnosed with SSCD are adults. Although the incidence of finding SSCD on a scan is the same for adults and children, the incidence of symptomatic SSCD in children is much less. Dehiscence of bone in other parts of the otic capsule can produce similar syndromes, although they are much less common. Other locations include the posterior semicircular canal, the horizontal semicircular canal and cochlea. Posterior semicircular canal dehiscence is often due to a high riding jugular bulb but can also been seen with anomalies of the vestibular aqueduct, such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS). EVAS, by itself can also produce symptoms similar to SSCD. Horizontal semicircular canal dehiscence is most frequently the result of an eroding process such as cholesteatoma. The cochlea can have bony dehiscence where it abuts the carotid artery and at the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve. Lastly, the bony opening where the hearing nerve enters the cochlea (at the internal auditory canal) can be abnormally wide, resulting in symptoms similar to SSCD. Because the condition of SSCD is still fairly new (identified in 1998), it could be argued that all treatments are considered experimental or investigational.  However, the most frequently employed are surgical. Surgery for SSCD has included resurfacing the defect with a variety of materials, plugging the superior semicircular canal, and a combination of resurfacing and plugging. These techniques can be done through a transmastoid or a middle fossa craniotomy approach. These techniques have found great success in reducing or eliminating the vestibular symptoms of SSCD. These techniques are also effective in reducing or eliminating autophony but they have not been effective in improving hearing.

Sweet syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by fever and the sudden onset of a rash, which consists of multiple tender, red or bluish-red bumps or lesions. These lesions usually occur on the arms, legs, trunk, face or neck. In some cases, additional systems of the body can become involved including the musculoskeletal system such as inflammation of the joints (arthritis), the eyes such as inflammation of the conjunctiva or the membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctivitis), and the internal organs. In the majority of affected individuals, the disorder occurs by itself for no known reason (idiopathic Sweet syndrome); this is also known as classical Sweet syndrome. Less often, the disorder can be associated with an underlying cancer (malignancy), usually a blood (hematologic) cancer such as certain types of leukemia; this is known as malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome. The disorder can also result as a reaction to taking certain drugs, especially a drug known as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; this is known as drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome is treated with corticosteroids. Classical Sweet syndrome in adults affects women more often than men by as much as 15:1 by some estimates. This female preponderance has not been seen in malignancy-associated or drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Classical Sweet syndrome usually affects women between the ages of 30-50, but can be seen in individuals of any age including children. There is no gender predominance seen in children. Several hundred individuals of Sweet syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. Only approximately 80 children have been reported in the medical literature. A diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of classic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. In many cases, surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic examination of small samples of skin tissue may reveal the infiltrate of neutrophils in the dermis. A complete blood cell count may also show neutrophils in the blood (neutrophilia).

"TORCH Syndrome refers to infection of a developing fetus or newborn by any of a group of infectious agents. ""TORCH"" is an acronym meaning (T)oxoplasmosis, (O)ther Agents, (R)ubella (also known as German Measles), (C)ytomegalovirus, and (H)erpes Simplex. Infection with any of these agents (i.e., Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses) may cause a constellation of similar symptoms in affected newborns. These may include fever; difficulties feeding; small areas of bleeding under the skin, causing the appearance of small reddish or purplish spots; enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); yellowish discoloration of the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes (jaundice); hearing impairment; abnormalities of the eyes; and/or other symptoms and findings. Each infectious agent may also result in additional abnormalities that may be variable, depending upon a number of factors (e.g., stage of fetal development). TORCH Syndrome results from one of the TORCH agents having crossed the placenta during pregnancy.  These infectious agents include Toxoplasma gondii, the single-celled microorganism (protozoa) responsible for Toxoplasmosis; rubella virus; cytomegalovirus; and herpes simplex viruses.  (Note: According to some reports, the acronym "TORCH" is sometimes modified to the term "STORCH" to include syphilis, a disease that may result in symptoms similar to those associated with the other TORCH agents.  Syphilis is caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum.  In addition, TORCH may encompass other disease-causing agents, such as varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus responsible for chickenpox, and parvovirus.) TORCH syndrome may affect a developing fetus or newborn, potentially resulting in miscarriage, delayed fetal growth and maturation (intrauterine growth retardation), or early delivery. Treatment of newborns and infants with TORCH Syndrome is based upon the specific causative agent, the stage of fetal development when infection initially occurred, the severity of the infection and associated symptoms and findings, and/or other factors. For infants with toxoplasmosis, treatment may include administration of the medication pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine. Herpes simplex may be treated with the antiviral agent acyclovir. The treatment of newborns and infants with rubella or cytomegalovirus primarily includes symptomatic and supportive measures."

Weil syndrome, a rare infectious disorder, is a severe form of the bacterial infection caused by Leptospira bacteria known as leptospirosis. Weil syndrome is characterized by dysfunction of the kidneys and liver, abnormal enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), persistent yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and/or alterations in consciousness. In most cases, Weil syndrome occurs among individuals who are exposed to affected animals. Weil syndrome is caused by an infection from the bacteria Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae or other related types of this bacteria (such as L canicola, or L pomona).  The infection is usually transferred to humans through urine or tissue of an infected domestic or wild animal.  The infection enters through a skin abrasion or the mucous membranes. Weil syndrome may occur in people of all ages.  At least 75% of persons infected with this disorder are male.  It can be an occupational disorder striking farmers, veterinarians, or sewer and abattoir workers, but most patients are exposed incidentally during recreational activities. The results of various laboratory tests, including blood and urine tests, assist in the diagnosis.

The spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs), are characterized by degeneration of nerve cells (motor nuclei) within the lowest region of the brain (lower brainstem) and certain motor neurons in the spinal cord (anterior horn cells) leading to muscle weakness of the truncal, and extremity muscles initially, followed by chewing, swallowing and breathing difficulties. Motor neurons are nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses from the spinal cord or brain (central nervous system) to muscle or glandular tissue. Werdnig-Hoffmann disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of all types of spinal muscular atrophy has been estimated to be 4-7.8 per 100,000 live births. Approximately 80% of SMA patients have the Werdnig-Hoffmann form.	spinal muscular atrophies @RAREDISEASE@ degeneration of nerve cells within lower brainstem @SIGN@ @Produces@ spinal muscular atrophies @RAREDISEASE@ degeneration of anterior horn cells @SIGN@ @Produces@ spinal muscular atrophies @RAREDISEASE@ muscle weakness @SIGN@ @Produces@ SMAs @RAREDISEASE@ spinal muscular atrophies @RAREDISEASE@ @Is_acron@ Werdnig-Hoffmann disease @RAREDISEASE@ spinal muscular atrophy @DISEASE@ @Is_a@ Werdnig-Hoffmann disease @RAREDISEASE@ SMA @RAREDISEASE@ @Is_a@ Werdnig-Hoffmann disease @RAREDISEASE@ the Werdnig-Hoffmann form @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@ 
Smith-Magenis syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence is estimated to be 1 in 15,000-25,000 people in the general population in the United States.

SMS has been reported throughout the world and in all ethnic groups.	@NOREL@
Split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM) is a genetic disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of some fingers or toes, often combined with clefts in the hands or feet. There may also be the appearance of webbing between fingers or toes (syndactyly). This may give the hands and/or feet a claw-like appearance. Split hand/split foot malformation affects males and females equally.  Frequency is estimated at one out of 18,000 newborns. The diagnosis of SHFM is based on physical features present at birth.  X-rays may provide additional information about the skeletal anomalies. Molecular genetic testing by DNA analysis is available for SHFM4, caused by a mutation in the TP63 gene. Mutations in the TP63 gene are responsible for only about 10% of all cases of SHFM.

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when women are pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. It is a rare disease of the placenta, the organ that joins the mother to her offspring and provides nourishment to the developing fetuses. During the development of identical twins, there are always blood vessels in the fetuses' shared placenta that connect their blood circulations (placental anastomoses). In most cases, the blood flows properly through these vessels. However, in twin-twin transfusion syndrome, the blood begins to flow unevenly, with one fetal twin receiving too much blood (recipient) and one receiving too little (donor). The recipient twin may experience heart failure due to continual strain on its heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular system). The donor twin, on the other hand, may experience life-threatening anemia, insufficient nutrition and oxygen due to its inadequate supply of blood. Such an imbalance in blood flow (i.e., twin-twin transfusion) can occur at any time during the pregnancy, including during delivery. TTTS is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when a mother is pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. There have been a few reported cases in which TTTS also affected identical triplets. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome affects approximately 5 to 15 percent of identical twin pregnancies, meaning that approximately 6,000 babies may be affected each year. However, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of TTTS in the general population since many cases are never diagnosed and many go unrecorded.

The WAS-related disorders are a spectrum of conditions affecting the immune system that are caused by mutations in the WAS gene. These disorders include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked thrombocytopenia and X-linked congenital neutropenia. The WAS gene abnormality results in a deficiency in the WASP protein that leads to a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).  WAS-related disorders usually present in infancy and are characterized by bloody diarrhea, recurrent infections, scaling, itchy, skin rashes (eczema), and the appearance of small purple spots on the skin (petechia). The development of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and intracranial bleeding are possible early, life-threatening complications. Later potential complications include destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), arthritis, vasculitis and kidney and liver damage.  Affected individuals have an increased risk of developing lymphomas, especially after exposure to Epstein-Barr virus. WAS-related disorders are extremely variable, even in individuals in the same family. The estimated prevalence of WAS-related disorders is 3/1,000,000 males.  This condition has been described in many ethnic groups and in many countries. A WAS-related disorder is suspected based on clinical features and laboratory testing.  Testing shows a low platelet count and small platelet size, and sometimes shows abnormal levels of serum immunoglobulins: low IgM, elevated IgA and IgE, decreased absolute numbers of CD8+ T cells and decreased function of natural killer cells. Decreased or absent WASP protein in blood cells strengthens the diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing for the WAS gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.

Spina bifida is characterized by incomplete closure of certain bones of the spinal column (vertebrae), leaving a portion of the spinal cord exposed. Part of the contents of the spinal canal may protrude through this opening. In the most severe form, rachischisis, the opening is extensive. Spina bifida may cause difficulties with bladder control, walking and/or other functions, depending on the severity of associated symptoms. Spina bifida is the most common neural tube defect in the United States. Between 1,500 and 2,000 babies out of about 4 million births are born with this disorder each year in the United States. Spina bifida is usually an isolated birth defect but it can also occur as part of a syndrome with other birth defects.  It is one of a group of disorders known as neural tube defects.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a rare congenital heart disorder involving irregularities in the electrical system of the heart. In individuals with WPW syndrome, an abnormal alternate electrical pathway (accessory pathway), exists between the atrium and the ventricle, resulting in abnormal heartbeat rhythms (arrhythmias) and faster than normal heartbeats (tachycardia). WPW syndrome is often present at birth (congenital), but may not be detected until adolescence or later. Peak incidence has been reported in individuals between 30 and 40 years old in otherwise healthy adults. Some reports suggest that WPW syndrome occurs in males more often than females. The disorder's estimated prevalence is .1-3.1 per 1,000 people in the United States.

Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium (microorganism) treponema pallidum. It is transmitted by direct contact with an infected lesion, usually through sexual intercourse. When untreated, syphilis progresses through primary, secondary and latent stages. The early stages of syphilis may not have any detectable symptoms. In some cases, symptoms can remain dormant for years. Eventually any tissue or vascular organ in the body may be affected. Syphilis is caused by a bacterium (microorganism) known as treponema pallidum and acquired through sexual contact with an infected person. On rare occasions, health workers have become infected while examining affected individuals with infectious lesions. It may also be acquired by kissing someone with oral infectious lesions. Infected mothers can transmit syphilis to the fetus in the womb, a condition known as congenital syphilis. (For more information on this disorder choose "congenital syphilis" as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) A diagnosis of syphilis, which is often difficult because of mild or absent symptoms in early states, is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic symptoms. Blood tests may be used to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis, but may be difficult to interpret and often give false negative results. A physician may also obtain a small sample of tissue by scraping an ulcer or rash for microscopic study in order to determine the presence of the syphilis bacteria.

Tricho-dento-osseous (TDO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that belongs to a group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasias. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, and/or skin. TDO syndrome is characterized by kinky or curly hair; poorly developed tooth enamel; and unusual thickness and/or denseness (sclerosis) of the top portion of the skull (calvaria) and/or the long bones (i.e., bones in the arms and legs). In some cases, affected individuals also exhibit abnormally thin, brittle nails or premature closure (fusion) of the fibrous joints between certain bones in the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the head to appear abnormally long and narrow (dolicocephaly). Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Approximately 12 affected families (kindreds) have been reported in the medical literature.  TDO syndrome is usually apparent between the ages of approximately six months to one year..

Short bowel syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is usually acquired during life, but in rare cases may be present at birth (congenital). In adults, short bowel syndrome usually results from the surgical removal of a portion of the small intestine. Crohn's disease is the most frequent cause of surgical removal of the small intestine in adults. In newborns, necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common cause of surgical removal of the small intestines. The exact incidence and prevalence of short bowel syndrome in the general population is unknown.	Short bowel syndrome @RAREDISEASE@ The disorder @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@ 
Valinemia is a very rare metabolic disorder. It is characterized by elevated levels of the amino acid valine in the blood and urine caused by a deficiency of the enzyme valine transaminase. This enzyme is needed in the breakdown (metabolism) of valine. Infants with valinemia usually have a lack of appetite, vomit frequently, and fail to thrive. Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and hyperactivity also occur. Valinemia is usually present at birth.  Symptoms in the newborn period include protein intolerance, metabolic acidosis, frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, and coma.  The condition may become life-threatening.  The levels of the amino acid valine in the blood and urine are elevated.  Abnormally low muscle tone, excessive drowsiness, and/or hyperactivity can also occur. Valinemia is a rare disorder, occurring once in about 250,000 live births in the United States.  It is present in affected infants at birth.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an acute or chronic bacterial infection found most commonly in the lungs. The infection is spread like a cold, mainly through airborne droplets breathed into the air by a person infected with TB. The bacteria causes formation of small tissue masses called tubercles.  In the lungs these tubercles produce breathing impairment, coughing and release of sputum. TB may recur after long periods of inactivity (latency) if not treated adequately. Many variations of TB exist and are distinguished by the area of the body affected, degree of severity and affected population. This disease today is considered curable and preventable. It is very rare in the United States but is on an upsurge.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare cancer of the nasal cavity and/or paranasal sinuses. Initial symptoms range from bloody nose, runny nose, double vision, and bulging eye to chronic infections and nasal obstruction. It has been associated with several types of papilloma in the nasal cavity, which are benign, but can give rise to malignancy. Prior irradiation for other cancers has been associated with the development of SNUC in a number of cases, and has been associated with a genetic mutation known to be associated with cancer development. Most patients have not had prior irradiation, and no other causes have demonstrated to be significant, though some studies have found that woodworkers and nickel factory workers are generally more susceptible to sinonasal malignancy of all types. Symptoms include bloody nose (epistaxis), runny nose (rhinorrhea), bulging eye (exopthalmos/proptosis), double vision (diplopia), nasal obstruction, and nasal infection. There is no regional predilection for SNUC.  It affects people in all countries more or less equally, based on available evidence.  There is approximately a 2:1 male:female prevalence, and the average age from available published studies is 53 years old.  The age range is 14 to 83 years old.

Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of disease ranging from a mild movement disorder at one end to a life-threatening, neurological disorder at the other. The symptoms of the disorder can vary widely from person to another, even among members of the same family. Common symptoms include an uncoordinated or clumsy manner of walking (abnormal gait) and dystonia. Dystonia is a general term for a group of muscle disorders generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). Dystonia in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency usually affects the legs. Additional symptoms that may occur include tremors, eye abnormalities, and a tendency of affected children to walk on their tiptoes. The severe form of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency causes symptoms at a very young age (first months of life). The symptoms generally do not resemble those of a movement disorder, but rather give the impression of a severe, diffuse brain disorder. Mild and moderate forms of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency show dramatic improvement when treated with levodopa. Levodopa is an amino acid that is converted to dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that serves as a neurotransmitter and is deficient in children with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. Treatment options for severe tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency have been less effective. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency occurs due to disruptions or changes (mutations) of the TH gene. The TH gene mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The exact incidence of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency in the general population is unknown. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Researchers believe that the disorder is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I deficiency (autosomal dominant Segawa syndrome) account for approximately 5-10 percent of all cases of primary dystonia in childhood. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency was first described in the medical literature in the 1970s.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe periorbital headaches, along with decreased and painful eye movements (ophthalmoplegia). Symptoms usually affect only one eye (unilateral). In most cases, affected individuals experience intense sharp pain and decreased eye movements. Symptoms often will subside without intervention (spontaneous remission) and may recur without a distinct pattern (randomly). Affected individuals may exhibit signs of paralysis (palsy) of certain cranial nerves such as drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), large pupil, and facial numbness. The affected eye often abnormally protrudes (proptosis). The exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is not known, but the disorder is thought to be associated with inflammation of specific areas behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). While the exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is unknown, one theory is an abnormal autoimmune response linked with an inflammation in a specific area behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). In some cases, inflammation may be due to a clumping of a certain type of cell (granulomatous inflammation). Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body's natural defenses against "foreign" or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Other possible causes may include generalized inflammation and constricted or inflamed cranial blood vessels. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare neuro-immunological disorder that occurs in males and females in equal numbers. The average age of onset is 41 years, but there have been cases reported among people younger than age 30. In rare cases, children under the age of 10 have been diagnosed with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.

Tangier disease is a rare inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the blood. HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) is often referred to as the "good cholesterol" as it can facilitate the removal of cholesterol out of the walls of arteries, particularly the coronary (heart) arteries. Classic features of Tangier disease include fatty accumulations that present as enlarged and yellow- or orange-colored tonsils, or enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes. Tangier disease may also be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, moderate elevation in triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia), nerve disturbances (neuropathy), and rarely an opaqueness in the covering of the eye (corneal clouding). This disorder was originally named after the location in which it was first discovered - Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Later, the disease was further characterized as more individuals were found to have the disease in other areas of the United States and around the globe. Symptoms of Tangier disease are variable and depend on which organs are involved and the severity of those manifestations. Tangier disease is most often characterized by enlarged orange- or yellow-colored tonsils. This discoloration is due to fatty deposits accumulating in the tonsils. Fatty deposits can also form in other organs causing enlargement of the throat, liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Fat accumulations in nerves can cause disturbances and loss-of-sensation called peripheral neuropathy. Discoloration may also occur in the digestive system, particularly the rectum and large intestine. Cardiovascular disease has been reported in adults with Tangier disease. In rare cases, a clouding of the cornea of the eye can occur, but is generally mild and does not cause vision impairment. Tangier disease is a rare disorder with only approximately 100 cases diagnosed worldwide. Tangier disease is thought to be present at birth, but the age of diagnosis can be highly variable (from infancy through 7th decade) due to the nature of symptoms.

Tongue cancers are oral cancers that are differentiated by their location in the mouth and on the tongue. If the cancer is on the forward portion of the tongue, it is known as a squamous cell cancer of the oral tongue. If the cancer is located towards the rear third of the tongue, it is known as a squamous cell cancer at the base of the tongue. Tongue cancer is most common in men over age 60.  It is rare in people, particularly women, under age 40. Examination of a sample of tissue from the site of the suspected cancer by a qualified pathologist is the key to diagnosis. MRI and/or CAT scans may be ordered to determine the location and size of the growth. This examination will also determine the stage of the disorder (how advanced it may be), which in turn, will help determine the method and pace of treatment.

Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS1) is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS1 is characterized by thin, sparse scalp hair, unusual facial features, abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes, and multiple abnormalities of the "growing ends" (epiphyses) of the bones (skeletal dysplasia), especially in the hands and feet. Characteristic facial features may include a rounded (bulbous) "pear-shaped" nose, an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), dental anomalies, and/or unusually large (prominent) ears. In most cases, the fingers and/or toes may be abnormally short (brachydactyly) and curved. In addition, affected individuals may exhibit short stature. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. In most cases, Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I has autosomal dominant inheritance. Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. In those individuals with mild symptoms, a diagnosis may be easily missed or go unreported. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of this disorder in the general population. Many researchers suspect there may be a higher incidence of TRPS1 than is actually reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of TRPS1 may be suspected upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., rounded [bulbous] nose; thin, sparse hair; etc.). The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and X-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal distinctive abnormalities of the hands and feet (e.g., epiphyseal coning). Molecular genetic testing can reveal mutations of the TRPS1 gene.

Triploidy is a rare chromosomal abnormality. Triploidy is the presence of an additional set of chromosomes in the cell for a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the normal 46 chromosomes per cell. The extra set of chromosomes originates either from the father or the mother during fertilization. Infants with triploidy usually are miscarried early in the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues to term, the infant dies within the first days of life. A few affected individuals have been reported to have survived to adulthood, but suffered from developmental delay, learning difficulties, seizures, hearing loss and other abnormalities. Those that survive have mosaic triploidy, meaning that some cells have the normal number of 46 chromosomes and other cells have 69 chromosomes per cell.  Infants affected with complete triploidy suffer from growth restriction and multiple birth defects. Triploidy is the presence of a complete additional set of chromosomes. The triplication of the chromosomes is caused by the fertilization of an egg by two sperms, or the fertilization of an egg by a sperm that has an extra set of chromosomes or by the fertilization of an egg that has an extra set of chromosomes by a normal sperm. This disorder does not run in families and is not associated with maternal or paternal age. Triploidy accounts for 1-3 percent of all pregnancies. The condition occurs slightly more often in males than females; it is estimated that 2/3 of triploid pregnancies are male. The presence of multiple major malformations, low amniotic fluid and/or growth restriction on fetal ultrasound during pregnancy raises the suspicion of triploidy. The diagnosis can be made during pregnancy by chromosome analysis (karyotyping) of cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The diagnosis can be confirmed after birth by chromosome analysis of tissue (skin) obtained from the affected infant. Triploidy cannot be diagnosed by chromosome microarray testing. The accuracy of non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal (cff) DNA in the diagnosis of triploidy is still being studied. Abnormal levels of specific maternal blood proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, estriol and pregnancy-assisted plasma protein-A have been associated with an increased risk for triploidy.

WNT4 deficiency is an extremely rare disorder that affects females. The exact incidence of the disorder is unknown and it has only been identified in several women worldwide. Researchers believe that cases of WNT4 deficiency may often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder's true frequency in the general population. WNT4 deficiency is present at birth (congenital), but can go unidentified until adolescence.

Systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) is a rare acquired disorder characterized by acute and severe recurrent attacks associated with a rapid fall in blood pressure. Attacks often last several days and require emergency care. They are sometimes fatal. SCLS occurs most often in adults and the disease is very rare in children. SCLS is not hereditary. More than one half of patients have a monoclonal or M protein detected in the blood. The level of M protein is usually low.  The M protein is produced by what usually amount to small numbers of plasma cells in the marrow.   The M protein itself does not appear to cause the attacks. Many possible explanations have been offered including an autoimmune mechanism. Recently it has been suggested that capillary lining cells may be damaged by a factor in the blood, which is produced during the acute attack.  SCLS has been recognized in a range of racial backgrounds and nationalities. Although the cause of SCLS is not yet known, there appears to be no genetic predisposition to the disease. There are less than 100 patients reported in the world literature since its first description in 1960 by Clarkson. SCLS seems to occur more often in males and older adults. The disease may be more frequent than the literature suggests because the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. SCLS may be mistaken for a severe infection such as septic shock or toxic shock syndrome.  Some features such as the swelling may lead one to suspect heart failure or kidney disease. C-1 esterase inhibitor deficiency syndrome may present with a type of recurring edema called angioedema and is often thought of in patients presenting with SCLS. In some cases the hemoconcentration and resulting high hematocrit and hemoglobin level have been mistaken for polycythemia.

There are seventeen species of birds that are the known carriers of and transmit West Nile Encephalitis (WNE) to humans via the Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes. WNE first causes symptomatic or asymptomatic illness in wild migratory birds that act as viral replication factories. Wild birds infected with WNE contain high titers of the virus and remain viremic for 1-2 weeks, making them ideal hosts to perpetuate the disease. Mosquitoes transmit WNE from birds to humans. Horses, dogs, and other small animals may harbor WNE after being bitten; however, they are inefficient transmitters because viral titers are relatively low, and WNE viremia is short-lived in these animals. In the US the initial cases of WNE were first identified in the greater New York area, but cases have now occurred in western states. Wild birds with WNE virus have also been identified in parts of Canada. WNE is common in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa WNE seropositivity of children in Egypt is approximately 50%. WNE is the most common cause of viral aseptic meningitis or encephalitis in patients presenting to emergency departments in Cairo. Both sexes are affected equally and it is more frequent in elderly patients.

Tooth and nail syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that belongs to a group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasia, which group consists of more than 100 separate recognized syndromes. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the teeth, nails, hair, and/or skin. Tooth and nail syndrome is characterized by absence (hypodontia) and/or malformation of certain primary (deciduous) and secondary (permanent) teeth occurring in association with improper development (dysplasia) of the nails, particularly the toenails. In some cases, tooth and nail syndrome may be suspected at birth if one or more toenails and/or fingernails are absent. More commonly, the disorder is detected at approximately four or five years of age, when the absence of certain primary (deciduous) teeth and underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of nails may be noted. In some cases, a diagnosis of tooth and nail syndrome may not be confirmed until approximately seven to 15 years of age, when absence and malformation of several secondary (permanent) teeth and nail dysplasia has been verified. A diagnosis of tooth and nail syndrome is confirmed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and the identification of characteristic physical findings.

Given the limited number of patients available for characterization, the full extent of symptoms is yet to be described. The most common features observed include absence seizures, myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (onset from 7 months to 6 years, mean 3.7 years) and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. Speech difficulties and behavioral problems have been described. The most common EEG pattern observed comprises irregular, high ample, and generalized spike-and-waves. To date, the most extensive patient collection was published by Johannesen et al5 and includes 34 patients. In this cohort, cognitive development was impaired in 33/34 (97%) subjects; 28/34 (82%) had mild to moderate intellectual disability, with language impairment being the most common feature. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31/34 patients with a mean onset at 3.7 years. Cognitive assessment before epilepsy onset was available in 24/31 subjects and was normal in 25% (6/24). Two patients had speech delay only, and 1 had severe intellectual disability. After epilepsy onset, cognition declined in 46% (11 out of 24) of patients. The most common seizure types were absences, myoclonic, and atonic seizures. Sixteen patients (47%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for myoclonic-atonic epilepsy. Seven additional patients had different forms of generalized epilepsy, and two had focal epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG) findings were available in 27/31 patients showing irregular bursts of diffuse 2.5-3.5 Hz spikes/polyspikes-and-slow waves in 25/31. Two patients developed an EEG pattern resembling electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Ataxia was observed in 7 out of 34 patients of Epiletic Encephalopathy (21%).

Simian B Virus Infection is caused by a type of herpesvirus. It is an infectious disorder contracted chiefly by laboratory workers exposed to infected monkeys and/or simian tissue cultures. It is characterized by a viral invasion of the brain (Encephalitis) and the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain. Occasionally, the infection affects the spinal cord structures as well (Encephalomyelitis). Neurological damage may result from this infection. Without treatment, some cases of Simian B Virus may be life- threatening. Simian B Virus Infection is characterized by fever, headache, vomiting, discomfort (malaise), and a stiff neck and back.  These symptoms may be associated with neuromuscular dysfunction, respiratory difficulties, vision problems, cranial nerve abnormalities, alteration of consciousness, personality changes, seizures and/or partial paralysis (paresis).  Some patients may go into a coma.

Werner syndrome is a rare progressive disorder that is characterized by the appearance of unusually accelerated aging (progeria). Although the disorder is typically recognized by the third or fourth decades of life, certain characteristic findings are present beginning during adolescence and early adulthood. Werner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1904 (O. Werner), more than 800 cases have been reported. The disorder's frequency has been estimated at one to 20 per one million individuals in the United States. Although certain associated findings are present beginning during childhood, puberty, and young adulthood, the disorder is most frequently recognized in the third or fourth decades of life.

"Setleis syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that belongs to a group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasias. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, and/or skin. Setleis syndrome is characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the facial area that may be apparent at birth (congenital). Most affected infants have multiple, scar-like, circular depressions on both temples (bitemporal). These marks closely resemble those made when forceps are used to assist delivery. In addition, affected infants may have puffy, wrinkled skin around the eyes (periorbital) and/or abnormalities of the eyelashes, eyebrows, and eyelids. Infants with Setleis syndrome may be missing eyelashes on both the upper and lower lids, or they may have multiple rows of lashes on the upper lids but none on the lower lids. In addition, in some cases, the bridge of the nose may appear flat, while the tip may appear unusually rounded (bulbous). Affected infants often have loose, excessive (redundant) skin, particularly in the area of the nose and the chin. Due to such facial abnormalities, infants with Setleis syndrome may have an aged and/or ""leonine"" (lion-like) appearance. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Most cases of Setleis syndrome are thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Setleis syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The majority of these cases have occurred in individuals from Puerto Rico. Setleis syndrome is usually diagnosed shortly after birth based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic features, such as distinctive scar-like, circular depressions on both temples; an aged and/or ""leonine"" facial appearance; and characteristic abnormalities of the eyelashes, eyebrows, and eyelids. It is possible that microscopic examination of small samples of skin tissue (biopsy) from the temples may reveal abnormal thinning of the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) and absence of certain specialized structures normally located within the inner layer of the skin (e.g., sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles)."

Smallpox is an infectious disease caused by the variola virus. It is characterized by fever, a general feeling of ill health (malaise), headaches and back pain. These initial symptoms are followed by a rash and small, raised bumps or lesions (pocks) within two or three days. Smallpox was a highly contagious disease, but was declared eradicated in 1980. However, recently smallpox has become of interest because of the possibility of its use as a weapon of warfare or of terrorism. There were two strains of smallpox, variola major and variola minor.

Physical urticaria is a condition in which red (erythematous) allergic skin lesions and itching (pruritus) are produced by exposure to heat, cold, or contact with chemicals or plants. These are called wheals by the medical community and may range in size from a couple of millimeters to a couple of centimeters. The center of the lesion may range in color from white to red, and it is usually surrounded by a flare of red skin. The disorder occurs most commonly in children. The underlying cause of physical urticaria is unknown in most cases. Some clinicians believe that an auto-immunological process is responsible. Cold urticaria occurs most often in infants, although it sometimes occurs in adults. The patient history and physical examination are the tools most often used to diagnose physical urticaria. If there is a history of reactions to physical triggers, the diagnosis may be confirmed with a challenge. The challenge is the application of the suspected agent, for example ice or light, to the skin, in hope of getting a response.

Thyroid cancer (carcinoma) is cancer affecting the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped structure located at the base of the neck. The thyroid is part of the endocrine system, the network of glands that secrete hormones that regulate the chemical processes (metabolism) that influence the body's activities as well as regulating the heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. Hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream where they travel to various areas of the body. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 64,300 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Of those cases, more than 49,350 will occur in women. In fact, thyroid cancer is now the 5th most common cancer in women. Thyroid cancer can affect individuals of any age and specific forms occur with greater frequency among different age groups. In general, thyroid nodules in children and adolescents are more likely may be malignant than those that occur in adults. In general, for unclear reasons, the rate of thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades. Some researchers believe that this increase in frequency is due to the greater use of imaging (CT scans, MRI), with the result being an increase in the rate of detection of small thyroid cancers that may not ever have been detected while the individual was alive. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 is a rare genetic cancer syndrome in which tumors develop in the endocrine glands (e.g., thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands). Two main subtypes exist called MEN 2A and MEN 2B. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is considered a third subtype. Nearly all individuals with MEN 2 develop medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) at some point. (For more information on these disorders, choose "multiple endocrine neoplasia" as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)

The specific underlying cause of vasculitis is not fully understood. However, in most cases, vasculitis is thought to be due to disturbances of the body's immune system. Some forms of vasculitis may be due to allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to certain medications such as sulfur drugs, penicillin, propylthiouracil, other drugs, toxins, or other inhaled environmental irritants. Other forms may occur due to fungal, parasitic, or viral infections. In some instances, it is thought that vasculitis may be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body's natural defenses against "foreign" or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Because of the wide range of symptoms and body systems involved, an extensive history and physical exam is needed before a clear diagnosis of the type of vasculitis can be made. In some cases, an x-ray of the blood vessels using dye (angiogram), or a biopsy of the affected organ may be recommended to give an accurate diagnosis and to insure proper treatment.	@NOREL@
The symptoms, progression and severity of SRS does not appear to vary from patient to patient. Affected children have a "gestalt" consisting of facial dysmorphism with a prominent lower lip, an asthenic build, low muscle mass, kyphoscohosis and speech abnormalities. Males with SRS have low muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth. Symptoms appear early, especially the facial features. Developmental milestones are also not met early in life. The developmental delay progresses such that many boys with SRS have some motor disability. Osteoporosis develops which can result in numerous fractures without a causative event. Seizures are not common and severity varies. Snyder-Robinson syndrome is a rare X-linked intellectual disability disorder and as such it is difficult to estimate its prevalence. As SRS has been identified in patients located in the United States, South America and Europe, it is likely not restricted to any ethnic population geographical locale. Many XLID disorders present with hypotonia very early in life. However, SRS is the only human disorder related to an abnormality in polyamine biosynthesis.

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a rare disorder of unknown origin that affects many body systems, including as the eyes, ears, skin, and the covering of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges). The most noticeable symptom is a rapid loss of vision. There may also be neurological signs such as severe headache, vertigo, nausea, and drowsiness. Loss of hearing, and loss of hair (alopecia) and skin color may occur along, with whitening (loss of pigmentation) of the hair and eyelashes (poliosis). Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is more prevalent in Oriental, Hispanic, and American Indian populations than in people who trace their ancestry to northern Europe. Onset typically occurs at around 30 or 40 years of age, but cases have been reported among children as young as four years old.

Trigeminal neuralgia affects females slightly more often than males. Although the exact incidence is unknown, approximately 10,000-15,000 new cases occur each year in the United States. The disorder most frequently affects individuals more than 50 years of age. However, cases can occur in younger adults as well. In younger individuals, the cause is often idiopathic, but when compared to older adult cases  are more likely to be caused by damage to the central nervous system as in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Although extremely rare, TN can occur in children.	Trigeminal neuralgia @RAREDISEASE@ The disorder @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@ 
"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder in which deficiency of an enzyme (hexosaminidase A) results in excessive accumulation of certain fats (lipids) known as gangliosides in the brain and nerve cells. This abnormal accumulation of gangliosides leads to progressive dysfunction of the central nervous system. This disorder is categorized as a lysosomal storage disease. Lysosomes are the major digestive units in cells. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or ""digest"" nutrients, including certain complex carbohydrates and fats. When an enzyme like hexosaminidase A, which are needed to breakdown certain substances like fats, are missing or ineffective, they build up in the lysosomal. This is called abnormal "storage". When too much fatty material builds up in the lysosome, it becomes toxic destroying the cell and damaging surrounding tissue."

Symptoms of Wieacker syndrome include stiffening of the muscles and joints of the feet (contracture), slowly progressive atrophy of certain muscles of the legs and arms, and mild intellectual disability. Other symptoms are impairment or inability to move the eyes despite the wish to do so, and impairment in the use of face and tongue muscles. In some cases, affected individuals may have droopy eyelids (ptosis), crossed eyes (strabismus), and farsightedness (hyperopia). Abnormal curvature of the spine may also occur (kyphoscoliosis). The prevalence of Wieacker syndrome is not known. Wieacker syndrome usually affects males, but some carrier females show mild manifestations of the disorder. As of 2015, the syndrome has been reported in 5 families. ZC4H2 gene mutations have also been identified in 3 sporadic patients who presented more or less severe intellectual disability and congenital contractures of multiple joints, at least equinovarus of the feet, associated with neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness, spasticity, seizures and ptosis. In one of the families, those affected had neonatal respiratory distress responsible for early death. Wieacker syndrome is therefore now considered to be part of a wider phenotype consisting of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (congenital multiple joint contractures) and intellectual disability, caused by ZC4H2 gene mutations. In some instances in the history of the family in which the syndrome was first described, the syndrome was present at birth.

Simpson dysmorphia syndrome types 1 and 2 are two forms of a rare, X-linked recessive, inherited disorder characterized by unusually large fetuses (prenatal overgrowth) and unusually large babies (postnatal overgrowth). In addition, affected individuals have characteristic facial features, more than two nipples (super-numerary nipples), and multisystemic malformations that may vary from child to child. Chief among these are cardiac malformations, mild to moderate mental retardation, cleft palate, and more than the five fingers and/or toes (polydactyly). Simpson dysmorphia syndrome is apparent at birth (congenital).  The syndrome has been diagnosed only in males, although the carrier females may display symptoms to varying degrees.  Between 10 and 20 affected families with SDYS1 have been recorded in the medical literature. The variant SDYS2 has been recorded in 1 family.

Yunis-Varon syndrome is a rare genetic multisystem disorder with defects affecting mostly the skeletal system, the nervous system, and ectodermal tissue (hair and teeth). It is characterized by large fontanelles, clavicular hypoplasia, characteristic facial features and/or abnormalities of fingers and toes. Characteristic features may include microcephaly, ear abnormalities, anteverted nares, midfacial hypoplasia, tented upper lip and small jaw (micrognathia), sparse or absent eyebrows and/or eyelashes. Abnormalities of the fingers and toes may include absence (aplasia) or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the fingers and toes. Most infants with this disorder experience severe feeding problems and respiratory difficulties. Some of these difficulties are related to the severe involvement of the central nervous system, with malformations of the brain affecting half of the children and hypotonia (low tone) affecting all of them. In addition, affected infants may have heart defects (e.g., abnormal enlargement of the heart muscle [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]). Frequently, feeding problems, respiratory difficulties, and/or heart defects may result in life-threatening complications during infancy. Yunis-Varon syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Yunis-Varon syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. 25 cases from 19 families have been reported since the disorder's initial description in the medical literature in 1980.

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that is rare in the United States. However, it is not rare in many other countries. Major symptoms may include unusually high fever, headache, loss of appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Typhoid is caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi.  It is the most serious of the Salmonella infections.  Contaminated food or water is most often the source of a Typhoid outbreak.  Contact with a carrier of the bacterium, polluted water, infected food or milk, shellfish harvested from polluted water, or fresh vegetables grown in contaminated soil are all sources of the Salmonella Typhi bacterium.  People who have had Typhoid are "carriers" until the bacteria is completely gone from their body.  If they touch food served to other people when their hands are not properly washed, they can spread Typhoid to those who eat the food. Typhoid is treated with the antibiotic drugs chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cefoperazone, pefloxacin, co-trimoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Precautions to take, especially when visiting countries with unsanitary conditions, includes the practice of good personal hygiene and careful washing of hands. Avoid drinking untreated water, drinks served with ice, unpeeled fruits and vegetables, and other food that is cooked and not served hot. In food preparation; wash and sanitize utensils in hot water; carefully clean cutting boards, work areas and equipment; keep hot foods at 165 F and cold foods at 40 F or colder to avoid the possible growth of bacteria in food. Typhoid vaccination and food precautions are necessary before traveling to developing countries where this kind of disease is prevalent.

Segawa syndrome affects girls and women more often than boys and men. In sporadic cases (i.e., new mutations), women are affected four times more often than men. Women are also more likely to have severe symptoms than men are. The exact incidence of Segawa syndrome in the general population is unknown. Researchers believe that the disorder is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Segawa syndrome and tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency, which is also known as autosomal recessive dopa-responsive dystonia, account for approximately 5-10 percent of all cases of primary dystonia in childhood. Segawa syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1971. It was originally called hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation.

Tyrosinemia type I is a rare autosomal recessive genetic metabolic disorder characterized by lack of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), which is needed for the final break down of the amino acid tyrosine. Failure to properly break down tyrosine leads to abnormal accumulation of tyrosine and its metabolites in the liver, potentially resulting in severe liver disease. Tyrosine may also accumulate in the kidneys and central nervous system. Tyrosinemia type I affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence has been estimated to be 1 in 100,000 to 120,000 births worldwide. In Quebec, Canada, the birth prevalence is estimated to be 1/16,000. The estimated prevalence in the Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region of Quebec is one in 1,850 births. In Norway, the birth prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 60,000 births.

AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG52 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizure, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is an acquired progressive muscle disorder that becomes apparent during adulthood. The symptoms and progression of sIBM vary from one person to another. In most cases, sIBM is characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration (atrophy) of the muscles especially those of the arms and the legs. sIBM can progress to cause severe disability. sIBM is an autoimmune disease mediated by cytotoxic T cells, but the exact cause of the disorder is unknown. sIBM, like all autoimmune diseases, is a complex disorder and, most likely, multiple factors including genetic, immunological and environmental ones in combination all play a role in its development.

"Yaws is an infectious tropical disease caused by the spirochete (spiral shaped) bacterium known as Treponema pertenue. The disease presents in three stages of which the first and second are easily treated. The third, however, may involve complex changes to the bones in many parts of the body. The first stage is characterized by the appearance of small, painless bumps on the skin that group together and grow until they resemble a strawberry. The skin may break open, forming an ulcer. The second stage (usually starting several weeks or months after the first) presents with a crispy, crunchy rash that may cover arms, legs, buttocks and/or face. If the bottoms of the feet are involved, walking is painful and the stage is known as ""crab yaws."" Stage 3 yaws involves the long bones, joints, and/or skin. Yaws is very common in tropical areas of the world but it is not known in the United States. It is not a sexually transmitted disease. It occurs in children younger than 15 years of age. Yaws is an infectious disease caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete) known as Treponema pertenue.  Yaws is usually transmitted by direct contact with the infected skin sores of affected individuals. In some cases, yaws may be transmitted through the bite of an infected insect. The diagnosis of stage 1 and stage 2 yaws is made by microscopic examination of tissue samples (darkfield examination) from the skin lesions of affected individuals. Stage 3 yaws may be diagnosed by specialized blood tests (i.e., VDRL and treponemal antibodies)."

SHORT syndrome is a rare condition in which affected individuals have multiple birth defects in different organ systems. SHORT syndrome was first described by RJ Gorlin et al in 1975 based on the striking physical features of two infants born to normal parents. Over time, more affected individuals have been described and the clinical definition of SHORT syndrome has been expanded. Each letter of SHORT syndrome represents one of the common findings in affected persons: SHORT syndrome is a very rare disorder with fewer than 50 reported cases in the literature to date. SHORT syndrome is not known to be more prevalent in a certain ethnic group or geographic location.

"A uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from the smooth muscle lining the walls of the uterus (myometrium). There are essentially two types of muscles in the body: voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles; the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, the myometrium stretches during pregnancy to help accommodate the fetus and contracts during labor to help push out a baby during childbirth. Leiomyosarcoma is a form of cancer. The term ""cancer"" refers to a group of diseases characterized by abnormal, uncontrolled cellular growth that invades surrounding tissues and may spread (metastasize) to distant bodily tissues or organs via the bloodstream, the lymphatic system, or other means. Different forms of cancer, including leiomyosarcomas, may be classified based upon the cell type involved, the specific nature of the malignancy, and the disease's clinical course. Leiomyosarcoma is classified as a soft tissue sarcoma. Sarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from the connective tissue, which connects, supports and surrounds various structures and organs in the body. Soft tissue includes fat, muscle, never, tendons, tissue surrounding the joints (synovial tissue), and blood and lymph vessels. The exact cause of leiomyosarcoma, including uterine leiomyosarcoma, is unknown."	uterine leiomyosarcoma @RAREDISEASE@ malignant tumor that arises from myometrium @SIGN@ @Produces@ Leiomyosarcoma @RAREDISEASE@ cancer @DISEASE@ @Is_a@ leiomyosarcomas @RAREDISEASE@ cancer @DISEASE@ @Is_a@ Leiomyosarcoma @RAREDISEASE@ soft tissue sarcoma @DISEASE@ @Is_a@ uterine leiomyosarcoma @RAREDISEASE@ leiomyosarcoma @RAREDISEASE@ @Is_a@ 
Sporadic porencephaly is a rare disorder affecting the central nervous system. In porencephaly, cysts or cavities form on the surface of the brain. These cysts or cavities may become filled with cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid that normally surrounds the brain and spinal cord to provide protection and nourishment. The severity and associated symptoms of porencephaly vary dramatically from one person to another based upon the size and exact locations of the fluid-filled cavities or cysts. Some infants develop serious complications shortly after birth; others individuals may have mild symptoms that may go undetected. The exact incidence of sporadic porencephaly in the general population is unknown. Some researchers believe that some patients may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder's true frequency in the general population. Sporadic porencephaly affects males and females in equal numbers. A diagnosis of sporadic porencephaly can be made before or after birth through a variety of specialized imaging tests such as an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During an ultrasound, reflected sound waves are used to make an image of the developing fetus. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues.	porencephaly @RAREDISEASE@ cavities form on the surface of the brain @SIGN@ @Produces@ porencephaly @RAREDISEASE@ cysts on the surface of the brain @SIGN@ @Produces@ porencephaly @RAREDISEASE@ cysts filled with cerebrospinal fluid @SIGN@ @Produces@ porencephaly @RAREDISEASE@ cavities filled with cerebrospinal fluid @SIGN@ @Produces@ porencephaly @RAREDISEASE@ fluid-filled cavities @SIGN@ @Produces@ porencephaly @RAREDISEASE@ fluid-filled cysts @SIGN@ @Produces@ sporadic porencephaly @RAREDISEASE@ the disorder @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@ 
The exact cause is not known (idiopathic). Some researchers have speculated that multiple microtrauma to the anterior chest wall may cause the development of Tietze syndrome. Sometimes, the development of the disorder may be preceded by chronic, excessive coughing, vomiting, trauma or impact to the chest, viral or bacterial infections, or surgery to the thoracic area. Tietze syndrome usually affects older children and young adults. Most cases occur before the age of 40, most often during the second or third decade of life. Although rare, Tietze syndrome has been reported in infants, children or the elderly. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown. A diagnosis of Tietze syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and exclusion of other causes of chest pain. A variety of tests including electrocardiogram, x-rays, and biopsies may be performed to rule out more serious causes of chest pain including cardiovascular disorders or malignant conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show thickening and enlargement of affected cartilage.

Sialidosis, also known as mucolipidosis type I, is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme neuraminidase (sometimes referred to as sialidase). Deficiency of neuraminidase results in the abnormal accumulation of toxic materials in the body. Sialidosis is divided into two types (i.e., type I and type II). Sialidosis type I usually becomes apparent during the second decade of life with the development of sudden involuntary muscle contractions (myoclonus), distinctive red spots (cherry-red macules) in the eyes, and sometimes additional neurological findings. Sialidosis type II is usually more severe than sialidosis type I. Type II often begins during infancy or later during childhood and is characterized by cherry-red macules, mildly coarse facial features, skeletal malformations and mild cognitive impairment. Sialidosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Sialidosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of sialidosis in the general population is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 in 4.2 million individuals in the Australian population. Another estimate placed the incidence at 1-4 individuals per 200,000 of the general population. Because rare disorders like sialidosis often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of sialidosis in the general population is difficult.

Toxic Shock Syndrome is a rare multisystem disease with many widespread symptoms. It is caused by a toxin that is produced and secreted by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome may include a sudden high fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension), and a characteristic skin rash that resemble a bad sunburn. Most cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome occur in menstruating females in association with the use of tampons. Other cases may occur in association with postoperative wound infections, nasal packing, or other factors. The diagnosis of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) has been defined by the Centers for Disease Control clinical and laboratory criteria. TSS is considered probable if three or more criteria are met in association with peeling (desquamation) of affected skin or if five or more criteria are met in the absence of desquamation. The criteria include the following: fever; rash, with possible, subsequent peeling (desquamation), particularly on the palms and soles; low blood pressure (hypotension); the involvement of three or more organ systems (i.e., digestive [gastrointestinal], muscular, mucous membranes, kidneys, liver, blood, and/or brain and spinal cord [central nervous system]). and negative results of blood tests for the infectious diseases Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Leptospirosis, and Measles.  Sometimes S. aureus may be isolated from the vagina or from localized (focal) wound sites and identified with the use of various laboratory techniques (e.g., bacterial cultures).

TM has a conservatively estimated incidence of between 1 and 8 new cases per million per year, or approximately 1400 new cases each year. Although this disease affects people of all ages, with a range of six months to 88 years, there are bimodal peaks between the ages of 10 to 19 years and 30 to 39 years. In addition, approximately 25% of cases are in children. There is no gender or familial association with TM. In 75-90% of cases TM is monophasic, yet a small percentage experience recurrent disease especially if there is a predisposing underlying illness. As mentioned above, TM may be a relatively uncommon manifestation of several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, and sarcoidosis. SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown cause that affects multiple organs and tissues in the body. SLE may cause TM that may even be recurrent. Sjogren's disease is another autoimmune disease characterized by invasion and infiltration of the tear and salivary glands by white blood cells with resultant decreased production of these fluids leading to dry mouth and dry eyes. Several tests can support this diagnosis: the presence of a SS-A/SS-B antibody in the blood, ophthalmologic tests that confirm decreased tear production and the demonstration of lymphocytic infiltration in biopsy specimens of the small salivary glands (a minimally invasive procedure). Neurologic manifestations are unusual in Sjogren's syndrome, but spinal cord inflammation can occur. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown cause and manifested by enlarged lymph nodes, lung inflammation, various skin lesions, liver and other organ involvement. In the nervous system, various nerves, as well as the spinal cord, may be involved. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by biopsy, demonstrating features of inflammation typical of sarcoidosis.

Senior Løken syndrome (SLS; OMIM #266900) is a rare disorder belonging to the general group of rare diseases called ciliopathies that result in nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. Nephronophthisis is the progressive wasting of the filtering unit of the kidney; it is characterized by cysts that develop in the kidneys during infancy or early childhood. Individuals will also develop symptoms of early-onset retinal dystrophy, a progressive retina disease that damages vision, within the first few years of life. Eventually the individual may experience renal failure and vision loss. Senior Løken syndrome is a very rare disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated that the prevalence is 1/1 million people worldwide. Only a few families with the condition have been described in the medical literature.

Wilms' tumor is a type of kidney cancer that occurs in young children. It is responsible for 95% of all malignant kidney tumors in patients under the age of 15 years old. Wilms' tumor can occur in one kidney (unilateral) or in both kidneys (bilateral) and can spread throughout the rest of the body. There are about 650 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States with the average age of diagnosis being 2 to 5 years of age. Wilms' tumor is the most common pediatric kidney cancer, and the fourth most common pediatric cancer overall. Wilms' tumor affects approximately 1 in 10,000 children with the median age of onset being 3.5 years. Girls are slightly more likely than boys to develop Wilms' tumor and African Americans are also at a higher risk.

Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is named after the investigator (PJ Waardenburg) who first precisely described the disorder in 1951. At least 1,400 cases have since been recorded in the medical literature. Evidence suggests that WS may have a frequency of approximately one in 40,000 births and account for about two to five percent of cases of congenital deafness. The disorder appears to affect males and females relatively equally.

Yellow Fever is a viral infection that causes damage to the liver, kidney, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Major symptoms may include sudden onset of fever, yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and hemorrhage. It occurs predominately in South America, the Caribbean Islands and Africa. The disease is spread through bites of infected mosquitos. Incidence of the disease tends to increase in the summer as the mosquito population increases, and it occurs year round in tropical climates. Yellow Fever is caused by a virus spread by the bite by an infected mosquito. Initially, a mosquito acquires the disease by ingesting the blood of an infected host.  The mosquito then transmits the infection to its next bite victim. Yellow Fever affects males and females equally. People living in semitropical or tropical climates are at risk unless they are vaccinated against this infection. People in southern areas of the United States, living near marshes and swamps may be at risk during the summer months. However, most cases of Yellow Fever occur in Africa and South America. The treatment of Yellow Fever is symptomatic and supportive. Preventative measures consist of mosquito control and a vaccine that prevents development of the infection. Immunity from a vaccination usually develops after 10 days and lasts for more than 10 years. In some cases, side effects associated with vaccination may occur five to 10 days later. These side effects affect approximately 5 percent of individuals receiving immunization and may include headache, fever, and/or aching muscles.

Urachal cancer is a form of cancer that arises in a structure called the urachus. The urachus is a canal that exists when the fetus is developing before birth. This canal runs from the bladder of the fetus to the belly button (umbilicus). It drains the urinary bladder of the fetus. Between the fourth and fifth month of pregnancy, this canal breaks down (degenerates) into a fibrous band of tissue called a ligament. This ligament runs from the belly button to the top of the bladder and is called the median umbilical ligament. Sometimes, there are tissue remnants of the urachus in adults (about 1/3 of adults have urachal tissue remnants). This usually does not cause any problems. However, sometimes these remnants can potentially become cancerous (malignant). Urachal cancer will often extend into surrounding structures like the bladder, and can potentially spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. The exact, underlying cause of urachal cancer is not fully understood. Surgery is the most common treatment option. Urachal cancer is a rare disorder. The exact prevalence and incidence of this form of cancer in the general population is unknown. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. Urachal cancer accounts for less than 1% of bladder cancers. Males and females are affected. Most people are in their 40-50s when diagnosed with the disorder.

Syringobulbia is a neurological disorder characterized by a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord that extends to involve the brainstem (medulla). It usually occurs as a slit-like gap within the lower brainstem that may affect one or more of the cranial nerves, causing facial palsies of various kinds. In addition, sensory and motor nerve pathways may be affected by compression and/or interruption. This disorder is intimately associated with syringomyelia, in which the syrinx is limited to the spinal cord, and to the Chiari I malformation. The cause of Syringobulbia is unknown.  The disorder is usually present from birth. Syringobulbia can affect people of either sex.  It usually is apparent before 30 years of age.  In one study of a pediatric population, the average age of onset of symptoms was just under 15 years of age. The diagnosis of syringobulbia is made by means of neuroimaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Wernicke syndrome and Korsakoff syndrome are related disorders that often occur due to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Wernicke's syndrome, also known as Wernicke encephalopathy, is a neurological disease characterized by the clinical triad of confusion, the inability to coordinate voluntary movement (ataxia), and eye (ocular) abnormalities. Korsakoff's syndrome is a mental disorder characterized by disproportionate memory loss in relation to other mental aspects. When these two disorders occur together, the term Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is used. In the United States, most cases occur in alcoholics. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome occurs in 1-2 percent of the general population in the United States. The disorder affects slightly more males than females and is evenly distributed between ages 30-70.

Zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of rare, genetic, multisystem disorders that were once thought to be separate entities. These disorders are now classified as different expressions (variants) of one disease process. Collectively, they form a spectrum or continuum of disease. Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form; neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy is the intermediate form; and infantile Refsum disease is the mildest form. Zellweger spectrum disorders can affect most organs of the body. Neurological deficits, loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), hearing loss, vision problems, liver dysfunction, and kidney abnormalities are common findings. Zellweger spectrum disorders often result in severe, life-threatening complications early during infancy. Some individuals with milder forms have lived into adulthood. Zellweger spectrum disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Zellweger spectrum disorders are also known as peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) - a group of disorders characterized by the failure of the body to produce peroxisomes that function properly. Peroxisomes are very small, membrane-bound structures within the gel-like fluid (cytoplasm) of cells that play a vital role in numerous biochemical processes in the body. PBDs are subdivided into the three Zellweger spectrum disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.  Zellweger spectrum disorders are usually apparent at birth. They affect individuals of all ethnic groups. In the United States, the combined incidence of these disorders is at least 1 in 50,000 live births. Because some cases go undiagnosed, determining these disorders true frequency in the general population is difficult.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under the age of 1 year that remains unexplained after careful review of the history, death scene investigation, and thorough autopsy. In 2008, the most recent published data from the National Vital Statistics System indicated that SIDS was listed as the third leading cause of death in infants in the United States. Causes of SIDS are considered to be multifactorial. The triple risk hypothesis describes the presence of three risk factors that, when overlapping, predispose a baby to SIDS. These include an environmental trigger/stress, a critical developmental period, and an underlying vulnerability. Physician-scientists and scientists are studying neuropathological tissue and genetic material from SIDS victims to ascertain factors that might be responsible for heightening an infant's vulnerability to SIDS. Others are performing physiologic studies on infants known to have an increased risk for SIDS. Basic scientists are studying animal models that might provide insight into mechanisms responsible for SIDS. Current clinical management targets improving education for families and caregivers regarding known modifiable environmental stressors (risk factors) (see below). There are typically no symptoms prior to a SIDS death. Though SIDS occurs during sleep, the deaths may occur during day or night time sleep. Existing literature does not indicate any evidence for suffering by the infant in the moments preceding the sudden death. SIDS can affect all infants under 1 year of age. Most deaths occur less than 6 months of age with the peak affected age between 2 and 4 months. Gender, ethnic and racial differences also exist. For example, boys are at greater risk for SIDS than girls. Also, the SIDS rate in African American infants is 2.7 times greater than the Caucasian rate in the US. Likewise, SIDS rates are increased in the American Indians and Alaskan natives as compared to Caucasians. These differences may reflect both cultural practices and genetic variations. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion which means that it is only determined as the cause of death after thorough investigation of clinical history, scene of death, and autopsy reveal no other cause.

Williams syndrome, also known as Williams-Beuren syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by growth delays before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation), short stature, a varying degree of mental deficiency, and distinctive facial features that typically become more pronounced with age. Such characteristic facial features may include a round face, full cheeks, thick lips, a large mouth that is usually held open, and a broad nasal bridge with nostrils that flare forward (anteverted nares). Affected individuals may also have unusually short eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), flared eyebrows, a small lower jaw (mandible), and prominent ears. Dental abnormalities may also occur including abnormally small, underdeveloped teeth (hypodontia) with small, slender roots. Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and infants of any race may be affected. The prevalence of this disorder is approximately one in 10,000-20,000 births in the United States. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation that includes a detailed patient history and specialized blood tests that may detect elevated levels of calcium in the blood. Another test, known as fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH], may be used to determine whether a deletion of one elastin gene on chromosome 7 is present. This deletion is believed to occur in the majority of individuals with Williams Syndrome.

STWS has a very low prevalence of <1 out of 1,000,000. However, the disease is relatively common in the United Arab Emirates with a prevalence of 1 out of 20,000 births, owing to the fact that parents are often closely related by blood (consanguineous). STWS affects males and females in equal numbers. Patients with STWS often go unrecognized making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population. STWS was first described in the medical literature in 1971.	STWS @RAREDISEASE@ the disease @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@ STWS @RAREDISEASE@ the disorder @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@ 
Sirenomelia, which is also known as mermaid syndrome, is an extremely rare congenital developmental disorder characterized by anomalies of the lower spine and the lower limbs. Affected infants are born with partial or complete fusion of the legs. Additional malformations may also occur including genitourinary abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, anomalies of the lumbarsacral spine and pelvis and absence or underdevelopment (agenesis) of one or both kidneys. Affected infants may have one foot, no feet or both feet, which may be rotated externally. The tailbone is usually absent and the sacrum is partially or completely absent as well. Additional conditions may occur with sirenomelia including imperforate anus, spina bifida, and heart (cardiac) malformations. Sirenomelia is often fatal during the newborn period. The exact cause of sirenomelia is unknown, most cases occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). Sirenomelia affects males more often than females by a ratio of 2.7-1. The exact incidence is unknown, but sirenomelia is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 60,000 to 100,000 births. Sirenomelia occurs with greater frequency in one twin of identical (monozygotic) twins than it does in fraternal (dizygotic) twins or individuals. A diagnosis of sirenomelia can be made prenatally, most often during the second trimester, by fetal ultrasound. An ultrasound is an exam that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the developing fetus. A fetal ultrasound can detect some of the defects associated with sirenomelia.

Spastic paraplegia 50 (SPG50) is a slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorder that generally presents with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, small head size (microcephaly), seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. Hypotonia (low-muscle tone) develops into hypertonia (high-muscle tone), resulting in spasticity of the legs that leads to non-ambulation and wheelchair reliance. Spasticity may progress to the upper extremities, leading to the partial or total loss of use of all four limbs and torso (tetraplegia). AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG50 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.

The infection usually involves the small intestine, but over time, the disease may affect various parts of the body, including the heart, lungs, brain, and eyes. Whipple disease is caused by a rod-shaped bacterium called Tropheryma whippelii.  This bacterium was first identified in 1991/92.  Its natural habitats are unknown, but it appears likely that infection occurs by way of an environmental source and that the bacteria are introduced into the body through the mouth (peroral). Whipple disease affects more males than females in a ratio of approximately 4 to 1.  The symptoms of this disorder typically begin between the ages of thirty and sixty years.  The age range of those affected is thought to be between 30 and 80, with the median age at time of diagnosis being 56 years.  Most of the cases of Whipple disease have been diagnosed among Europeans and  Americans of European parentage.  In Germany, the disease incidence has been estimated at 0.4 per million population per year.  A few cases have been reported among American Indians and Americans of African descent. In 2004, for the first time, a case of Whipple disease was reported in Japan. The standard diagnostic approach is to study a tissue sample (biopsy) from the small intestine. Blood testing can determine whether anemia is present. Confirmation of diagnosis can be achieved either by electron microscopy or by a test known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which detects the DNA of T. whippelii.

"Congenital wandering spleen is a very rare, randomly distributed birth defect characterized by the absence or weakness of one or more of the ligaments that hold the spleen in its normal position in the upper left abdomen. The disorder is not genetic in origin. Instead of ligaments, the spleen is attached by a stalk-like tissue supplied with blood vessels (vascular pedicle). If the pedicle is twisted in the course of the movement of the spleen, the blood supply may be interrupted or blocked (ischemia) to the point of severe damage to the blood vessels (infarction). Because there is little or nothing to hold it in place the spleen ""wanders"" in the lower abdomen or pelvis where it may be mistaken for an unidentified abdominal mass. The diagnosis of wanderin. spleen is suspected when the pain associated with an abdominal mass can be relieved by moving it toward the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, the normal position of the spleen. Wandering spleen may be confirmed by specialized examinations such as ultrasonography and CT scan that enable the physician to view the structure, size, and placement of the spleen within the abdomen or pelvis. Specialized ultrasound tests (i.e., Doppler studies) may show impaired blood flow in and out of the spleen. Radioisotopic scanning (technetium 99 sulfur colloid scan), another imaging test, allows the physician to determine how well the liver and spleen are functioning. Low spleen function (functional asplenia) may suggest that the organ is damaged as a result of arterial obstruction (infarct)."

Status epilepticus (SE) is considered a neurological emergency. Left untreated (or undertreated), prolonged seizures can cause permanent neurological injury or death. Rapid treatment must be initiated. If initial agents fail, it may be necessary to induce an iatrogenic coma. In any case, the person in status epilepticus must be closely watched, and often requires continuous EEG in order to confirm that the seizures have stopped not only clinically but electrically as well. It is estimated that 150,000 people develop epilepsy each year in the United States. Per the MMWR report from the CDC, the overall prevalence for Epilepsy is 4.6/1000 in the general population while it is 4.1/1000 for population less than 15 years in age. The incidence of Epilepsy is more predominant in the extremes of age i.e. more frequent among children and older adults. Approximately 15 percent of people who have epilepsy have Status Epilepticus. Combined together approximately two to three million Americans have epilepsy but the majority of affected individuals are seizure free due to effective medications.

All types of SCID are very rare disorders that occur in approximately 1 or fewer births in 100,000 in the United States. SCID may be more common in people with Navajo, Apache, or Turkish ancestry. SCID is now diagnosed mainly through from newborn screening in most states.  The screen is performed using the dried blood spot from newborn screening (or Guthrie) cards measuring levels T-cell receptor excision circles (or TREC).  Although each state has a slightly different methods and thresholds, a low TREC test means the infant has low numbers of lymphocytes in the blood at the time of the test.  The result must then be confirmed with additional testing. A complete blood count (CBC) coupled with lymphocyte subset testing may show low levels of B, T, and/or NK cells. Additional tests can show that one or more of these cell types aren't functioning properly. Genetic and biochemical (protein expression) tests are available for some forms of SCID. A combination of these tests may be required to make an accurate diagnosis needed to plan treatment.

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder caused by a missing piece (partial deletion or monosomy) of the short arm of chromosome 4. Major symptoms may include extremely wide-set eyes (ocular hypertelorism) with a broad or beaked nose, a small head (microcephaly), low-set malformed ears, growth deficiency, heart (cardiac) defects, intellectual disability, and seizures. The symptoms of this syndrome vary from person to person based the size and location of the missing piece of chromosome 4. WHS is an extremely rare disorder. Studies undertaken about 25 years ago suggested that the disorder occurred in approximately 1 in about 50,000 live births with a female to male ratio of 2:1. More recent studies suggest that the frequency of the disorder is underestimated because of misdiagnosis. A diagnosis of WHS may be suggested by the characteristic facial appearance, growth failure, developmental delays, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of a deletion of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region (WHSCR) by cytogenetic (chromosome) analysis.  Conventional cytogenetic analysis detects less than half of the deletions that cause WHS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a WHSCR probe has much better detection rate than standard karyotype and will detect most patients. However, the diagnostic test of choice is chromosomal microarray, which detects essentially all deletions of the WHSCR and defines the size of the deletion.  Chromosomal microarray can also find other chromosome rearrangements, such as extra pieces of other chromosomes that are seen in many patients with WHS.

Truncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) in which there is a single main blood vessel, rather than the normal two, carrying blood away from the heart. Instead of having a separate pulmonary artery, to carry blood to the lungs, and aorta, to carry blood to the rest of the body, a baby with truncus arteriosus has just one blood vessel leaving the heart which then branches into other blood vessels. Blood from both ventricles of the heart is mixed, resulting in a situation in which some oxygen-rich blood travels needlessly back to the lungs and some oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body. Babies with this condition may have a bluish tint (cyanosis) to their skin, lips, and fingernails. In most cases, truncus arteriosus occurs in conjunction with a missing upper portion of the wall between the ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). The exact cause of truncus arteriosus is not known.  It has been suggested that some cases may develop due to the interaction of many genetic and environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance).  The malformation is the result of an error in embryonic development.  Approximately 35 percent of children with this disorder also have DiGeorge syndrome, which is a severe congenital immune deficiency disorder involving the thymus and parathyroid glands.  (For more information on DiGeorge Syndrome, see the Related Disorders Section of this report.) The diagnosis of truncus arteriosus is confirmed by clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram (EKG), and specialized imaging techniques that allow the physician to view the structure of the heart. These may include an echocardiogram, angiocardiogram, and/or cardiac catheterization.

Papular urticaria, usually called hives, is characterized by large numbers of very itchy red bumps (papules) that come and go every few days over a period of a month or so. The bumps are usually between 0.2 and 2 cm. in size and some may develop into fluid-filled blisters (bullae). This condition is usually triggered by allergic reactions to insect bites, sensitivity to drugs, or other environmental causes. In some cases, swelling of the soft tissues of the face, neck, and hands (angioedema) may also occur. Acute papular urticaria and angioedema are essentially exaggerated allergic reactions limited to the skin and tissues just under the skin (subcutaneous tissues).  The reaction may be caused by a drug allergy, by insect stings or bites, by desensitization injections (allergy shots) or ingestion of certain foods (particularly eggs, shellfish, nuts or fruits) by people who are allergic to these substances.  In some cases (such as reactions to strawberries), the reaction may occur only after overindulgence, and possibly result from direct toxic histamine release into the blood.  If acute angioedema is recurrent, progressive, and never associated with urticaria, a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be suspected. Children from 2 to 7 years are most commonly, but not exclusively, affected by papular urticaria. Children are especially susceptible in the summertime when the insect population increases.  It is more rare in adults, perhaps in part because adults build up a tolerance.

Tooth agenesis is a condition in which teeth are missing. Anodontia is a genetic disorder defined as the absence of all teeth. It usually occurs as part of a syndrome that includes other abnormalities.  Also rare but more common than anodontia are hypodontia and oligodontia. Hypodontia is genetic in origin and usually involves the absence of from 1 to 5 teeth. Oligodontia is genetic as well and is the term used to describe a condition in which six or more teeth are missing. The prevalence of anodontia is unknown. This condition affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of hypodontia is 2 to 8% of the general population (excluding third molar) and oligodontia is 0.09%. to 0.3%.

Susac syndrome is an autoimmune endotheliopathy, a disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the inside lining (endothelium) of the walls of the very tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the brain, retina, and inner ear. The exact, underlying reason why this occurs is unknown. Why the microvasculature in the brain, retina, and inner ear are primarily affected is also unclear. The skin may also be involved.

Sneddon syndrome is a rare progressive disorder affecting small- and medium-sized blood vessels. The disorder is characterized by the association of a skin condition and neurological abnormalities. Characteristic findings include multiple episodes of reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia) causing mini-strokes or stroke and bluish net-like patterns of discoloration on the skin surrounding normal-appearing skin (livedo reticularis). Additional symptoms may include headache, dizziness, abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension), and heart disease. Lesions may develop within the central nervous system as a result of reduced blood flow to the brain, which can cause reduced intellectual ability, memory loss, personality changes, and/or other neurological symptoms. The combination of stroke symptoms and livedo reticularis differentiates this syndrome from other disorders. The exact cause of Sneddon syndrome is not fully understood. Sneddon syndrome has been reported more often in females than in males. Almost 80% of the patients are women with a median age of diagnosis at 40 years. Symptoms usually begin in early to middle adulthood, but can occur at any age including childhood. The incidence and prevalence are unknown. One estimate places the incidence at approximately one out of 250,000 individuals in the general population.

WRS is an extremely rare genetic disorder that appears to affect males and females relatively equally. WRS has been observed in various ethnic and racial groups. The disorder was initially described as a distinct entity in 1979 (Wiedemann HR) based upon observation of two unrelated individuals as well as previous reports of two affected sisters in 1977 (Rautenstrauch T). More than 35 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature to date.	WRS @RAREDISEASE@ genetic disorder @DISEASE@ @Is_a@ WRS @RAREDISEASE@ The disorder @ANAPHOR@ @Anaphora@

Winchester syndrome is an extremely rare connective tissue disorder believed by some scientists to be closely related to the mucopolysaccharidoses, which is a group of hereditary metabolic diseases caused by the absence or malfunction of certain enzymes, leading to the accumulation in cells and tissues of molecules that would normally be broken down into smaller units. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, arthritis-like symptoms, nodules under the skin (subcutaneous), coarse facial features, and eye and teeth abnormalities. Winchester syndrome is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Since the original description of this syndrome in 1969, only about a dozen cases have been described in the medical literature.  Those identified with the syndrome to date have included individuals of Mexican, Indian, Puerto Rican and Iranian descent.  Additional affected individuals may be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Diagnostic criteria for Winchester syndrome were developed to include characteristic skeletal radiologic findings plus at least two of the following signs: short stature, progressive fusion (contractures) of the joints, cataracts, coarse facial features, darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation), and the growth of hair in the leathery patches of skin.

"Wildervanck syndrome, also known as cervicooculoacoustic syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects females. The disorder is characterized by a skeletal condition known as Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS); abnormalities of certain eye (ocular) movements (i.e., Duane syndrome); and/or hearing impairment that is present at birth (congenital). In individuals with KFS, there is abnormal union or fusion of two or more bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) within the neck (cervical vertebrae). Duane syndrome is characterized by limitation or absence of certain horizontal eye movements; retraction or ""drawing back"" of the eyeball into the eye cavity (orbit) upon attempting to look inward; and, in some cases, abnormal deviation of one eye in relation to the other (strabismus). In some affected individuals, additional physical abnormalities may also be present. In most cases, Wildervanck syndrome appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). As mentioned above, Wildervanck syndrome primarily affects females. Since the disorder was originally described in 1952 (L.S. Wildervanck), almost 90 cases have been reported in the medical literature. According to some reports, approximately one percent of females with hearing impairment may be affected by Wildervanck syndrome. Wildervanck syndrome may be detected at birth or during the first year of life based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and specialized tests. Diagnostic studies may include advanced imaging techniques, such as computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of internal structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to form detailed cross-sectional images of certain organs and tissues. Such techniques may help to detect and characterize abnormalities of the inner ear, union or fusion of certain bones of the spinal column (e.g., cervical vertebrae), possible impingement of vertebrae on the spinal cord, or other abnormalities potentially associated with the disorder. In addition, in some individuals with Wildervanck syndrome, exploratory surgery may be conducted to detect malformations of the middle ear (exploratory tympanotomy). Additional specialized tests may also be performed to confirm or characterize other abnormalities that may be associated with the disorder (e.g., certain ocular findings, congenital heart defects, renal abnormalities, etc.)."

Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a variable genetic disorder that is characterized by slow growth before and after birth, small head (microcephaly), mild to moderate mental retardation and multiple birth defects including particular facial features, cleft palate, heart defects, fused second and third toes, extra fingers and toes and underdeveloped external genitals in males.  The severity of SLOS varies greatly in affected individuals, even in the same family, and some have normal development and only minor birth defects. SLOS is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that results in an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism.  SLOS is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. For the US the birth prevalence of SLOS has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 20,000 to 60,000 live births.  The predicted prevalence based on newborn screening for gene carriers is estimated to be 1 in 1,590 to 13,500 and this discrepancy may be due to the fact that many fetuses with SLOS are stillborn.   This condition occurs equally in males and females but females are often not diagnosed because genital abnormalities are missed.  SLOS occurs more often in individuals of European ancestry. The diagnosis of SLOS is based on physical findings and detection of an elevated concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in blood serum or an elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol:cholesterol ratio. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the DHCR7 gene is available and is mainly used for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.
